# Chapter 03: THE GOOD GIRL DOUBLE-BIND | 第三章：好女孩的双重束缚

> Me trying to ask someone for a favor: Hey could you help me with this thing? Absolutely no pressure though. Totally ok if you can't. If you'd rather run me over with a car that's cool. Are you mad at me? MEME, COURTESY OF THE INTERNET

> 我想找人帮忙时：嘿，你能帮我做这件事吗？不过绝对没有压力。如果你做不到也完全没关系。如果你想开车撞我，那也很酷。你生我气了吗？网络表情包

I guarantee it: the times and circumstances where you have felt truly powerful in your interactions with people in your life, you were completely occupying the appropriate state of attention.

我保证：在你与生活中的人互动时感到真正强大的那些时刻和情况下，你完全占据了适当的注意力状态。

That pitch, when you were so filled with conviction about what your company could do for that particular account—the complete strategy was so apparent to you, fully formed and perfect—you knew they were yours before you'd even started your spiel, right? And that morning you wanted your lover to come back to bed? You asked from a profound connection to that desire, and there was absolutely no way she could resist your request.

那次推销，当你对你公司能为那个特定客户做什么充满信心时——完整的策略对你来说如此明显，完全形成且完美——你甚至在你开始滔滔不绝之前就知道他们是你的，对吧？还有那个早晨，你想让你的情人回到床上？你从与那个欲望的深刻连接中提出要求，她绝对无法抗拒你的请求。

It feels magnificent when this happens, like there's a current running through you right into the other person, a mind-meld that makes anything possible.

当这种情况发生时，感觉非常美妙，就像有一股电流流过你，直接进入另一个人，一种心灵融合，让一切成为可能。

But what I am interested in is what happened during the times when you weren't able to access those states—why you lost track of the person you were guiding, even though you were in the dominant state, and why you lost track of yourself when you were in the submissive one.

但我感兴趣的是，在你无法访问那些状态的时候发生了什么——为什么你在支配状态下失去了对被引导者的跟踪，以及为什么你在顺从状态下失去了对自己的跟踪。

Why do you say no to the thing you want? Why do you suddenly find yourself mealymouthed and stammering, despite months of intense preparation? Why is that guy so visibly pissed off by the request you just made, even though you were so careful not to step on his toes—even though you were so nice?

为什么你对想要的东西说"不"？为什么尽管经过数月的紧张准备，你突然发现自己含糊其辞、结结巴巴？为什么那个男人对你刚才提出的请求如此明显地生气，即使你如此小心不要踩他的脚趾——即使你如此友好？

In short: What happens to your attention, to jam up the works?

简而言之：你的注意力发生了什么，堵塞了工作？

The answers lie in the way women are conditioned, which gives rise to a compression that makes it very difficult for us to feel safe and comfortable in either the submissive or the dominant state.

答案在于女性被条件化的方式，这产生了压迫，使我们很难在顺从或支配状态下感到安全和舒适。

### An Old Instruction Manual for a New World | 新世界的旧指令手册

Name one Good Girl who changed the world.

说一个改变世界的好女孩的名字。

You can't—because she can't.

你不能——因为她不能。

It is the Good Girl's job to maintain the status quo.

好女孩的工作是维持现状。

Good Girls are chaste and selfless. They're modest, accommodating, upbeat, friendly, low-maintenance, and appropriate—while remaining sexually available to sanctioned partners, of course.

好女孩是贞洁和无私的。她们谦逊、随和、乐观、友好、低维护且得体——当然，同时保持对合法伴侣的性可获得性。

A Good Girl is moderate, in temperament and appetite. She avoids conflict, responds in a timely fashion, considers others first, and is an expert at making do. She never outshines anyone, but she never falls behind, either. She adapts and harmonizes, responding to circumstances, and she doesn't ruffle feathers—which is precisely why she can never be a catalyst for change.

好女孩在性情和欲望上都是适度的。她避免冲突，及时回应，首先考虑他人，是凑合的专家。她从不超越任何人，但也从不落后。她适应和协调，对情况做出回应，她不会惹是生非——这正是为什么她永远不能成为变革的催化剂。

These qualities have been passed down and enforced—by society, by other women, and by ourselves. Good Girls exist because women are good at what they do, and for millennia, the best an ambitious woman could hope for was to marry as well as she could. Now, of course, we're expected to operate in a brave new world, one that presumes equality—but our conditioning comes straight from a manual that might as well be called "How to Be Marriageable," first printing circa 1890.

这些品质已经被传承和执行——被社会、被其他女性、被我们自己。好女孩之所以存在，是因为女性擅长她们所做的事情，几千年来，一个有野心的女性能希望的最好结果就是尽可能好地结婚。当然，现在我们被期望在一个勇敢的新世界中运作，一个假设平等的世界——但我们的条件反射直接来自一本可能被称为"如何适合结婚"的手册，首次印刷大约在1890年。

Good Girl conditioning pops up in myriad sneaky ways—in your rush to smooth the tension at every family gathering, the unnecessary disclaimers you offer before delivering a well-rehearsed presentation, the way you apologize to your intern, even though the feedback you gave him was clear, necessary, and in no way unkind. It's why one of my students didn't scream during her rape—"I didn't want to embarrass him"—and why another one stood aside and let her boss disinvite her to the meeting where he planned to launch the concept she'd spent three months developing.

好女孩的条件反射以无数狡猾的方式出现——在你急于在每次家庭聚会上缓和紧张，在发表一个充分排练的演讲之前你提供的不必要的免责声明，你向实习生道歉的方式，即使你给他的反馈是清楚的、必要的，并且一点也不不友善。这就是为什么我的一个学生在被强奸时没有尖叫——"我不想让他尴尬"——以及为什么另一个学生站在一旁，让她的老板取消邀请她参加他计划发布她花了三个月开发的概念的会议。

Maybe you're nodding your head, cataloging all the Good Girl behaviors you engage in. And maybe you're thinking: "Hey, fuck that. I'm no Good Girl."

也许你正在点头，列出你参与的所有好女孩行为。也许你正在想："嘿，去他妈的。我不是好女孩。"

Yeah, I'm not either. Except for the way I clean up before my housekeeper comes. Or the way I said I didn't care where a meeting was held, even though I strongly preferred that we do it downtown. Or the way I found myself absentmindedly apologizing when a guy bumped into me on the street.

是的，我也不是。除了我在管家来之前清理的方式。或者我说我不在乎会议在哪里举行，即使我强烈希望我们在市中心举行。或者当我发现自己在街上被一个男人撞到时心不在焉地道歉。

Most of the women I know and teach are powerful agents of their own destinies, moving through the world in impressive ways. But the truth is that very, very few of us escape Good Girl conditioning entirely. It may lie dormant for weeks and months; it may show up only in certain relationships or under duress. But the fiercest women I know describe, often with tears in their eyes, how it is their most dangerous—and unpredictable—saboteur.

我认识和教授的大多数女性都是自己命运的强大代理人，以令人印象深刻的方式在世界中移动。但事实是，我们中很少有人完全逃脱好女孩的条件反射。它可能潜伏数周和数月；它可能只在某些关系中或在压力下出现。但我认识的最强烈的女性描述，经常眼中含着泪水，它是她们最危险的——也是不可预测的——破坏者。

And we haven't even gotten to the Good Girl's newest and most insidious iteration: the Independent Woman, or Good Girl 2.0.

我们还没有谈到好女孩最新和最阴险的迭代：独立女性，或好女孩2.0。

The Independent Woman brings home the bacon and fries it up in a pan. She doesn't ask for help; she doesn't need it! She's got this—and if she doesn't, she's a wizard at MacGyvering what she needs from nothing.

独立女性把培根带回家并在平底锅里煎它。她不寻求帮助；她不需要！她能搞定——如果她不能，她是用无中生有的方式变出她需要的东西的魔法师。

Of course, it's a trap. Whereas the Good Girl is supposed to behave and not want anything, the Independent Woman can have whatever she wants—as long as she can get it herself. She doesn't burden anyone. She doesn't ask for help or favors. She's endlessly resourceful and competent, which usually means that she ends up helming the ship.

当然，这是一个陷阱。虽然好女孩应该行为端正，不想要任何东西，但独立女性可以拥有她想要的任何东西——只要她能自己得到它。她不给任何人负担。她不寻求帮助或恩惠。她无限有能力和胜任，这通常意味着她最终掌舵。

No wonder she's utterly exhausted. The Independent Woman might feel more powerful than an old-school Good Girl, but she's running on empty, and she's resentful as hell. And when she's doing it all so she can have it all, is she really as masterful as she would be if she could ask for the resources and support she needs?

难怪她完全筋疲力尽了。独立女性可能感觉比老式好女孩更强大，但她正在空转，她非常怨恨。当她做所有事情以便她能拥有一切时，如果她能要求她需要的资源和支持，她真的会如此熟练吗？

While I usually find that talking too much about society and its various ills is a dodge to avoid talking about what happens in a given moment between two people, this is a good example of the way that various societal structures have really let the modern woman down.

虽然我通常发现过多谈论社会及其各种弊病是避免谈论两个人之间特定时刻发生的事情的逃避，但这是各种社会结构真正让现代女性失望的一个很好的例子。

Women used to be property—and yes, that sucked for a whole lot of reasons I don't need to detail for you here. Now we own property; that's better. But as we move from noun to verb, we're doing so without many of the structures that used to support us. And we're doing so without any new ones in place, or, indeed, any of the invisible support systems that men rely on. (Like wives.)

女性曾经是财产——是的，这糟透了，有很多原因我在这里不需要详细说明。现在我们拥有财产；这更好。但当我们从名词转向动词时，我们在没有许多曾经支持我们的结构的情况下这样做。我们在没有任何新的结构就位的情况下这样做，或者，确实，没有任何男性依赖的看不见的支持系统。（比如妻子。）

To be clear: There's absolutely nothing wrong with either the Good Girl or the Independent Woman. Accommodate all you want in times of peace—my goal is to make you more generous and loving, not less. If your partner is dying for sushi and you don't care one way or the other, by all means, meet for dinner at the Japanese place. And I truly believe, as a woman who was raised by one, and who has spent the last six years training them, that the Independent Woman is a real heroine, evidence of women's graceful flexibility, tremendous stamina, and range. I'd never dream of asking her to relinquish her hard-won autonomy.

要清楚：好女孩和独立女性都没有任何问题。在和平时期，随和随你——我的目标是让你更加慷慨和充满爱，而不是更少。如果你的伴侣渴望寿司，而你不关心哪一边，那么，绝对可以在日本餐厅见面吃晚餐。我真正相信，作为一个被独立女性抚养长大的女人，以及过去六年一直在训练她们的女人，独立女性是真正的女英雄，是女性优雅灵活、巨大耐力和范围范围的证明。我绝不会梦想要求她放弃她来之不易的自主权。

The problem comes when we default to these behavior patterns—when we say "I'm fine" because we don't want to rock the boat or wear ourselves out doing it all because we can't ask for help. Gracious capitulation simply isn't appropriate when a doctor is dismissing your chest pains as indigestion, or when your boss is strongly implying that your promotion is tied to your willingness to date his nephew.

问题出现在我们默认这些行为模式时——当我们说"我很好"是因为我们不想惹麻烦，或者因为我们无法寻求帮助而让自己筋疲力尽。当医生把你的胸痛当作消化不良而忽视时，或者当你的老板强烈暗示你的晋升与你是否愿意和他的侄子约会有关时，优雅的屈服根本是不合适的。

In those moments, we have to be able to say no, and to keep going when we hear it. We have to be able to ask difficult questions. We have to be able to stay on message until our words land, without freezing or allowing a louder voice or a higher-status person to hijack the conversation, dragging in another topic so that the original issue is not resolved, or is resolved in an ineffective and inefficient way.

在那些时刻，我们必须能够说"不"，并在听到它时继续前进。我们必须能够提出困难的问题。我们必须能够保持信息直到我们的话落地，不要冻结或允许更响亮的声音或更高地位的人劫持对话，拖入另一个话题，使原始问题无法解决，或以无效和低效的方式解决。

To do this, we have to be able to break the compression that Good Girl conditioning causes in us—a compression that has a detrimental effect on how we communicate.

要做到这一点，我们必须能够打破好女孩条件反射在我们身上造成的压迫——这种压迫对我们如何沟通产生不利影响。

### Too Much and Not Enough: The Smush | 太多和不够：挤压

Your tits are too big, or they're not big enough. You're too mousy or you're too outspoken. You're an airhead or you're a know-it-all bore; you're a pushover or you're a bitch. You're frigid or you're a slut. (And when I ask a room full of women how many of them have been accused of being both—sometimes at the same time, and for the same behaviors!—I see a sea of hands.) You care too much about your family and not enough about your career, or maybe it's the other way around, but either way, you're walking a tightrope so narrow that there's barely an inch to move in either direction before you've fallen off the other side.

你的乳房太大，或者它们不够大。你太胆小，或者你太直言不讳。你是个没脑子的人，或者你是个无所不知的讨厌鬼；你是个容易受欺负的人，或者你是个婊子。你冷淡，或者你是个荡妇。（当我问一屋子女性有多少人被指控两者都是——有时是同时，并且因为同样的行为！——我看到一片手海。）你太关心你的家庭而对你的职业不够关心，或者也许相反，但无论哪种方式，你走在如此狭窄的钢丝上，在你从另一边掉下来之前，向任何方向移动几乎没有一英寸。

Sound familiar? Meet the Smush.

听起来熟悉吗？认识一下"挤压"。

The Smush—an inelegant name for a precarious position—is the ledge most women live on, the almost invisible amount of real estate between "too much" and "not enough."

挤压——一个不优雅的名称，用于描述一个危险的 position——是大多数女性生活的边缘，在"太多"和"不够"之间几乎看不见的不动产。

I'm hardly the first person to point out these unfair binaries. But the real problem, and my real concern, is what happens to your body—what happens to your energetics, to your vibe—when you're smushed.

我很难是第一个指出这些不公平二元对立的人。但真正的问题，我真正关心的，是你的身体发生了什么——你的能量学、你的氛围发生了什么——当你被挤压时。

It gets smushed.

它被挤压了。

When you're walking the impossible tightrope strung up between Bossy and Needy, a request or communication you make has to wind its way through that compression. And what that sounds like to the animal of someone else's body freaks them out.

当你在专横和需要之间走不可能走的钢丝时，你提出的要求或交流必须通过那种压迫蜿蜒前行。这对另一个人身体的动物来说听起来是什么样子，会让他们感到害怕。

This is why it can be so very difficult for a woman to ask for something or tell someone to do something in a way that feels good to her and to the person she's asking. A Good Girl doesn't want to seem pushy or domineering, but she doesn't want to seem helpless or pathetic, either. Contortions—verbal, physical, energetic—ensue.

这就是为什么一个女人以对她和她要求的人感觉良好的方式要求某物或告诉某人做某事是如此困难。好女孩不想显得咄咄逼人或专横，但她也不想显得无助或可怜。扭曲——语言的、身体的、能量的——随之而来。

With the help of the male volunteers at our school, we have had hundreds of opportunities to watch what happens to someone's body as they listen to an incongruent request, one that comes through the Smush. Even if the volunteer's face remains neutral, his body recoils.

在我们学校男性志愿者的帮助下，我们有很多机会观察某人的身体在听到不一致的请求时会发生什么，一个通过挤压来的请求。即使志愿者的脸保持中性，他的身体也会退缩。

What our body communicates when we make a request can be as loud as the words we use—and if we're not fully occupying one state of attention or the other, what we transmit will be in contrast to our intentions.

当我们提出请求时，我们的身体传达的可以和我们使用的词语一样响亮——如果我们没有完全占据一种或另一种注意力状态，我们传达的将与我们的意图形成对比。

And I will tell you one thing for sure: If you rile up the animal of someone else's body, you do not stand a chance of capturing their heart or their mind.

我告诉你一件事：如果你激怒了另一个人身体的动物，你没有机会抓住他们的心或他们的思想。

Let's take a look at an example of the Smush in action.

让我们看看挤压在行动中的例子。

It's almost midnight on a Tuesday. You get home, exhausted from a long day, wanting nothing more than to splash your face and sink into bed, but your next-door neighbor's music is so loud you can feel it in your molars.

这是周二的午夜时分。你回到家，从漫长的一天中筋疲力尽，只想洗把脸然后躺在床上，但你隔壁邻居的音乐如此响亮，你可以在你的臼齿中感觉到它。

You're furious. Who does this guy think he is? And seriously, Whitesnake? But you're also a nice person—a Good Girl—so you dutifully go next door with your polite request. "Um, sorry to bother you? I live in 6B, and your music is really loud. And I have a really big day tomorrow." Your voice is getting higher and louder; the fury you're feeling is starting to seep out around the edges. "So I was just wondering if you could turn it down a little? I'd appreciate it. Because it's, like, midnight." You asshole, you'd like to continue, but of course you leave that unsaid. "So, yeah, thanks." That sounded tight, brittle, bitchy, and you know it, so you give him a big Good Girl smile. Except that the smile never quite reaches your eyes and it's too late anyway: that throbbing vein in your forehead has already revealed your rage.

你很愤怒。这家伙以为他是谁？说真的，白蛇乐队？但你也是个好人——一个好女孩——所以你尽职尽责地走到隔壁，带着你礼貌的请求。"嗯，抱歉打扰你？我住在6B，你的音乐真的很响。我明天有一个非常重要的一天。"你的声音越来越高，越来越响；你感受到的愤怒开始从边缘渗出。"所以我想知道你能不能把它调低一点？我会感激的。因为现在是，比如，午夜。"你这个混蛋，你想继续，但你当然把那句话留在了没说出口的地方。"所以，是的，谢谢。"那听起来紧绷、脆弱、泼妇，你知道这一点，所以你给他一个大大的好女孩微笑。只是那个微笑从未真正到达你的眼睛，而且无论如何已经太晚了：你前额上跳动的血管已经暴露了你的愤怒。

Of course, this interaction goes badly. Maybe he gives you the finger and turns the volume up. Maybe he turns it down, visibly pissed, and you leave the exchange puzzled: "How come he seemed so irritated? I was so nice." His irritation is the outward manifestation of the cringey, unpleasant feeling you gave him—a response to your incongruence, or the fact that you failed to fully occupy a state of attention, shrinking away from both dominance and submission.

当然，这次互动进行得很糟糕。也许他给你竖中指并把音量调大。也许他调低了音量，明显生气了，你离开这次交流时感到困惑："为什么他看起来如此烦躁？我如此友好。"他的烦躁是你给他的令人尴尬、不愉快的感觉的外在表现——对你不一致的回应，或者你没有完全占据一种注意力状态的事实，从支配和顺从中退缩。

What I am most interested in is the opportunity lost. Ask your neighbor to turn the music down in an incongruent way, and he'll never be more than the guy you ignore during awkward elevator rides. But, as we will see, an Ask like this can be an opportunity to create a huge and exciting new role for someone in your life. Break the Smush, get congruent, and discover that confronting your neighbor about his noise is a blessing in disguise, an opportunity to create a new ally. Ask with congruence, and you might discover you've met someone who can accept packages, feed your cat, or let you know when someone creepy is loitering in the hallway. Yes—your neighbor might be a complete asshole, too! With your attention out, you'll be able to determine what you're dealing with. But you're never going to know if you don't break the Smush.

我最感兴趣的是失去的机会。以不一致的方式要求你的邻居调低音乐，他永远不会超过你在尴尬电梯乘坐中忽略的那个人。但是，正如我们将看到的，这样的要求可能是为你生活中的人创造一个巨大而令人兴奋的新角色的机会。打破挤压，获得一致性，发现面对你的邻居关于他的噪音是伪装的祝福，是创造新盟友的机会。以一致性提出要求，你可能会发现你遇到了一个可以接收包裹、喂你的猫，或让你知道什么时候有人鬼鬼祟祟地在大厅里徘徊的人。是的——你的邻居也可能是一个完全混蛋！如果你的注意力向外，你将能够确定你在处理什么。但如果你不打破挤压，你永远不会知道。

This is how Good Girl conditioning stands in the way of our ability to communicate powerfully in every situation, and at all times. Not because it makes us too nice, or because there's anything wrong with kindness, or service to others, or being polite, but because the Smush prevents a fully inhabited, embodied position in either of the two states of attention.

这就是好女孩的条件反射如何阻碍我们在每种情况下和任何时候都有力沟通的能力。不是因为它让我们太友好，也不是因为善良、为他人服务或礼貌有什么问题，而是因为挤压阻止了在两种注意力状态中的任何一种中完全居住、体现的位置。

A Good Girl can't sink into the delicious, surrendered space of the submissive; she's too worried about seeming incapable, needy, or frivolous. Instead, she specializes in not-needing, in "whatever you want to do is fine with me." Afraid of appearing selfish or greedy, she's uncomfortable receiving, and because she's always "fine," she never reaps the wonderful rewards that come from being cared for. She categorically minimizes herself, and then collects the dubious moral reward of seeing herself small.

好女孩不能沉入顺从者美味、投降的空间；她太担心显得无能、需要或轻浮。相反，她专门研究不需要，研究"无论你想做什么对我来说都可以。"害怕显得自私或贪婪，她对接收感到不舒服，因为她总是"很好"，她永远不会收获来自被照顾的美妙回报。她绝对地最小化自己，然后收集看到自己渺小的可疑道德奖励。

And of course she can't ask for what she wants! She's spent a lifetime denying that she has any appetites at all. Indeed, she may be so proficient at this Good Girl fuckery that she doesn't even recognize her desires for what they are.

当然，她不能要求她想要的！她花了一生否认她有任何欲望。事实上，她可能如此精通于这种好女孩的把戏，以至于她甚至不认识她的欲望是什么。

Neither is she able to confidently assert herself in a joyful, embodied way when it comes time to step into a position of dominance. She has a plan, and she knows more than anyone else in the room, but she never wants to seem like she's taking over. A lifetime of Good Girl conditioning has trained her to hold the part of herself back—the natural authority—that would make it safe for others to relax and submit in her presence.

当需要进入支配位置时，她也不能以快乐、体现的方式自信地坚持自己。她有一个计划，她知道比房间里任何人都多，但她从不希望看起来像是在接管。一生的好女孩条件反射训练她保留自己的一部分——自然权威——这会让其他人在她面前放松和屈服变得安全。

When she has to make a request, the Good Girl tends to default to dangerous leveling behaviors: body and spoken language to reassure the other person: "I'm no better than you are." She apologizes, equivocates, makes herself small (sometimes even physically, to the point where she stoops or cowers, or softens her words with a placating hand on the arm).

当她必须提出请求时，好女孩倾向于默认危险的平级行为：身体和口头语言向另一个人保证："我不比你更好。"她道歉，含糊其辞，让自己变小（有时甚至在身体上，到弯腰或畏缩的程度，或者用安抚的手放在手臂上软化她的话）。

If she has to deliver a correction, she camouflages her legitimate frustration in fake smiles. "What you've done is so great, obviously, but I was wondering if maybe next time we could try it a different way?" Of course, her animal body is telling the truth—that the job he did wasn't very good at all—and his body is hearing it, loud and clear.

如果她必须传达纠正，她在假笑中伪装她合法的挫败感。"你做的太棒了，显然，但我想知道也许下次我们能不能试试不同的方式？"当然，她的动物身体在说真话——他做的工作一点都不好——他的身体听到了，响亮而清晰。

Two people using "I" language in a discussion can be a fantastic and nonviolent way to disagree: "I feel and believe X." "But I feel and believe Y." But because the Good Girl is afraid to move into the dominant state of attention, she often uses submissive language to launch an ambush: "I feel like you don't give a shit about me." "I hate living in this city." "It would be really nice if you could take your kid to school for once in your life."

两个人在讨论中使用"我"的语言可能是不同意的一种奇妙和非暴力的方式："我感觉并相信X。"但我感觉并相信Y。"但由于好女孩害怕进入支配状态的注意力，她经常使用顺从的语言来发起伏击："我觉得你不在乎我。"我讨厌住在这个城市。"如果你能送你的孩子上学一次，那就太好了。"

You've likely heard this called passive-aggression, although I actively dislike the term because nobody really knows what it means. I prefer to call this state (and every one of us has been there) "bad sub," because it highlights the most important aspect, which is that the direction of attention is contradictory to the desired intent.

你可能听过这被称为被动攻击，虽然我积极不喜欢这个词，因为没有人真正知道它是什么意思。我更喜欢称这种状态（我们每个人都在那里）为"坏被支配者"，因为它突出了最重要的方面，即注意力的方向与期望的意图相反。

So let's take one of the comments above—"It would be really nice if you could take your kid to school for once in your life," and turn on the subtitles: Why does a comment like this look like a request and feel like an attack? Because of what it implies: "You are failing as a father and a husband. Every time I did drop-off, I secretly resented you. Even if you do it this one time, you're still worthless and self-involved in my eyes. If you were a better man, I wouldn't even have to bring this up."

所以让我们拿上面的一个评论——"如果你能在你的一生中送你的孩子上学一次，那就太好了，"并打开字幕：为什么像这样的评论看起来像请求但感觉像攻击？因为它暗示了什么："你作为父亲和丈夫是失败的。每次我送孩子上学，我秘密地怨恨你。即使你做这一次，在我眼中你仍然毫无价值和自私。如果你是一个更好的男人，我甚至不需要提出这个问题。"

How is he supposed to respond to that? Imagine hearing a request like that yourself. How would you feel? The so-called sub's attention is not in on herself, but out—on blast. She can drape her request in apologies and compliments and all the sweet talk she wants, but the other person's body knows the truth: it's being attacked.

他应该如何回应？想象一下你自己听到这样的请求。你会感觉如何？所谓的被支配者的注意力不在她自己身上，而是向外——在爆发。她可以用道歉和赞美以及她想要的所有甜言蜜语来包裹她的请求，但另一个人的身体知道真相：它正在被攻击。

Imagine how much more both parties would gain if the woman in this scenario could ask, with genuine curiosity about the answer, "Could you take the kid to school on Mondays and Wednesdays?" (a dominant Ask) or "It would mean a lot to me if I didn't have to take our kid to school every day. Could we have a conversation about that?" (a submissive one). Even a very dominant Ask—"Starting next week, it's your job to drop the kid off at school. Do you know what you'll need to do to make that happen?"—has a higher likelihood of moving the dynamic forward, as long as she asks with her attention all the way out—with congruence.

想象一下，如果这个场景中的女人能够以对答案的真正好奇问："你能在周一和周三送孩子上学吗？"（一个支配性要求）或"如果我不必每天送我们的孩子上学，对我来说意义重大。我们能谈谈吗？"（一个顺从的要求）。即使是一个非常支配性的要求——"从下周开始，送孩子上学是你的工作。你知道你需要做什么来实现吗？"——只要她以注意力完全向外——以一致性——提出要求，就更有可能推动动态向前。

I use the phrases "bad sub" and "bad domme" to describe people who use words and body language in contrast to where their attention is placed. And I use "bad" not because these people are acting amorally—I frankly don't give a shit if they do—but because they tend not to be effective at achieving their goals.

我使用"坏被支配者"和"坏女支配者"这些短语来描述那些使用的词语和身体语言与他们的注意力位置相反的人。我使用"坏"不是因为这些人行为不道德——老实说，我不在乎他们是否这样做——而是因为他们往往不能有效地实现他们的目标。

Anger is an outward-moving emotion. When it gets trapped in the Smush—when all that rage and attention are driven inward instead of moving up and out, the other person feels like they're standing next to a suicide bomber. You're not holding them in your attention and giving them an instruction on how they can heal or rectify the situation, but threatening to self-detonate.

愤怒是一种向外移动的情感。当它被困在挤压中时——当所有的愤怒和注意力都被向内驱动而不是向上和向外移动时，另一个人感觉就像站在一个自杀式炸弹袭击者旁边。你没有把他们放在你的注意力中并给他们关于如何治愈或纠正情况的指示，而是威胁要自我引爆。

When your words seem submissive, but your gaze and tone are set to kill mode, the other person's animal body will withdraw in response.

当你的话似乎顺从，但你的凝视和语调设置为杀戮模式时，另一个人的动物身体会撤退作为回应。

When we're trapped in the Smush, squeezed between Bossy and Needy, we can't ask questions like, "Are you saying that you're going to fire me if I don't sleep with you?" We huff and slam cabinet doors instead of asking for help. We end up crying when we're mad, and screaming because nobody listened the first ten times we asked. The Smush is why we hear ourselves ask a waiter for a cup of coffee like we're asking him to donate a kidney instead of to do his job, and why it's easier to walk down the aisle with the wrong guy than it is to tell him and everybody else that he's Mr. Wrong.

当我们被困在挤压中，被专横和需要之间挤压时，我们不能问这样的问题："你是说如果我不和你睡觉，你就要解雇我吗？"我们喘气和砰地关上柜门，而不是寻求帮助。我们在生气时最终哭泣，因为没有人听我们问的前十次而尖叫。挤压就是为什么我们听到自己要求服务员要一杯咖啡，就像我们在要求他捐赠一个肾脏而不是做他的工作，以及为什么和一个错误的人走红毯比告诉他和其他所有人他是错误先生更容易。

Historically, there have been heavy penalties and prohibitions against a woman assuming a dominant role. And because there are so few socially sanctioned ways for the Good Girl to say what she wants, she often ends up in a situation where it's easier to complain about the absence of something than it is to request it. When the Good Girl is faced with destructive behavior and needs to read someone the riot act, she often resorts to indirect incriminations: quiet, poisonous, sideways attacks. Or she holds her rage in for so long that she eventually explodes, recklessly and ineffectively.

历史上，对女性承担支配角色一直有严厉的惩罚和禁止。因为好女孩说她想要什么的社会认可方式如此之少，她经常最终陷入抱怨某物的缺失比请求它更容易的情况。当好女孩面临破坏性行为并需要向某人宣读暴乱法案时，她经常诉诸间接指控：安静、有毒、侧面的攻击。或者她把愤怒压抑了太久，最终爆炸，鲁莽而无效。

This is what people are talking about when they say men don't like dominant women. Men, like every other living creature, respond very well to dominance—as long as the person embodying that dominant state of attention is fully inhabiting it. What they respond badly to is incongruence.

这就是人们说男人不喜欢支配女性时谈论的内容。男人，像所有其他生物一样，对支配反应非常好——只要体现那种支配注意力状态的人完全占据它。他们反应不好的是不一致。

Congruence is what occurs when your attention—your body's language—is aligned with your intentions and words. It's hard to define but impossible to deny when felt or witnessed. You may have heard it called "embodiment," "alignment," "integrity," "resonance," or "the law of attraction"; I believe it to be a human being's natural state.

一致性是当你的注意力——你身体的语言——与你的意图和话语对齐时发生的事情。很难定义，但当感受到或见证时不可能否认。你可能听过它被称为"体现"、"对齐"、"完整性"、"共鸣"或"吸引力法则"；我相信这是人类的自然状态。

Practically speaking, congruence is what happens when we fully occupy a state of dominance or submission—when the direction of our attention is entirely aligned with the language we're using.

实际上，一致性是当我们完全占据支配或顺从状态时发生的事情——当我们的注意力方向与我们所使用的语言完全对齐时。

Most of us mistake communication for what we say. But true communication is measured by its impact, and our energetic authority extends past mere words. If what you say to others conveys information, then how you say it tells them how to receive it, how to feel about it, how seriously to take it, and how to act upon it.

我们大多数人都把沟通误认为是我们说的。但真正的沟通是通过其影响来衡量的，我们的能量权威超越了仅仅的话语。如果你对他人说的话传达了信息，那么你如何说它告诉他们如何接收它，如何感受它，如何认真地对待它，以及如何对它采取行动。

Language tells the other person what to do; your body tells their body how to feel about it.

语言告诉另一个人要做什么；你的身体告诉他们的身体如何感受它。

When there is a disparity between what our words are saying and what our bodies are saying, our requests and corrections add to the problem in the dynamic instead of resolving it.

当我们的词语在说什么和我们的身体在说什么之间存在差异时，我们的请求和纠正会在动态中增加问题而不是解决它。

So, in the case of your noisy neighbor, you could turn your attention outward, laying your voice and gaze on him like one of those delicious weighted blankets people use to treat anxiety, and make a dominant request: "Your music is really loud, and it's late. Will you turn it down, please?"

所以，在你的吵闹邻居的情况下，你可以将注意力向外转，把你的声音和凝视放在他身上，就像人们用来治疗焦虑的那些美味的加重毯子一样，并提出一个支配性的请求："你的音乐真的很响，而且很晚了。你能把它调低吗？"

Or you could hunker down into a sweet, submissive state and make the request from your deep connectedness, as if you're already inhabiting that blessed silence, sinking into your tub with a glass of wine and no hint of a driving bass line to torment your parasympathetic nervous system: "I've got a big day tomorrow, and I'd really love some quiet tonight. Will you turn your music off?"

或者你可以蹲下来进入一个甜蜜的、顺从的状态，从你的深层连接中提出请求，就好像你已经居住在那个神圣的寂静中，带着一杯酒沉入你的浴缸，没有任何驱动的低音线来折磨你的副交感神经系统："我明天有重要的一天，我真的很喜欢今晚的安静。你能把你的音乐关掉吗？"

In neither is there any: Well, I'm asking for something but I feel bad about asking for it and I don't feel like I deserve to get it and I don't know how to ask so that I don't seem like a controlling bitch or a desperate maiden in need of rescue, so I'm going to do this confusing, manipulative dance instead. . . . Both requests are clean. And because they are clean, they have a much higher likelihood of success.

在两者中都没有：好吧，我在要求某物，但我觉得要求它很糟糕，我不觉得我应该得到它，我不知道如何问，这样我看起来不像一个控制的婊子或一个需要救援的绝望少女，所以我要做这个令人困惑的、操纵性的舞蹈来代替......两个请求都是干净的。因为它们干净，它们成功的可能性要高得多。

What happens next is the possibility of influence.

接下来发生的是影响力的可能性。

Say you've approached your neighbor in sub mode, cozy in your pajamas and already living like the only sound you can hear is the wave setting on your meditation app. You make your request for a little peace and quiet, and the guy says no.

假设你以顺从模式接近你的邻居，穿着舒适的睡衣，已经生活得像你唯一能听到的声音就是你冥想应用程序上的波浪设置。你要求一点和平和安静，那个人说不。

It's time to move into a dominant state of attention—to turn your attention outward, onto him, so you can start asking some questions. "How come the music needs to be so loud?" He's studying, and he can't think without his dub-smash. "Okay, when do you anticipate being done?" He's going to be at it for a couple more hours.

是时候进入支配状态的注意力了——将你的注意力向外转，转向他，这样你就可以开始问一些问题。"为什么音乐需要这么响？"他正在学习，没有他的dub-smash他就无法思考。"好吧，你预计什么时候完成？"他要再花几个小时。

That won't work for you. "Is there another room you can study in, one that doesn't share an adjoining wall with my apartment?" Nope, it's a studio. "Could you move the speaker off the wall?" That, maybe, he can do.

那对你不起作用。"还有另一个房间你可以学习吗，一个不与我的公寓共享相邻墙壁的房间？"不，这是一个工作室。"你能把扬声器从墙上移开吗？"那个，也许，他可以做到。

Attention unlocks and reveals.

注意力解锁并揭示。

And this is so important, because keeping your wits about you will help you to correctly assess the situation. Maybe your neighbor's not a bad guy—just one so terrified of flubbing the bar exam again that the only thing keeping him at his desk is the Newsies cast recording on repeat and turned up to eleven. Maybe he is a bona fide jerk, and you're going to need to get your landlord involved.

这非常重要，因为保持你的机智将帮助你正确评估情况。也许你的邻居不是一个坏人——只是一个如此害怕再次搞砸律师资格考试的人，唯一让他坐在办公桌前的是《报童》演员录音重复播放并调到十一。也许他是一个真正的混蛋，你需要让你的房东介入。

From a submissive state, you can check in with what you're feeling and find out what you need. From a dominant state, you can see your neighbor clearly, make an assessment about what's going on, and sense and test your way toward a solution. Completely inhabiting each state of attention and moving fluidly between the two, you can create the possibility of a rapprochement.

从顺从状态，你可以检查你的感受并找出你需要什么。从支配状态，你可以清楚地看到你的邻居，评估正在发生的事情，并感知和测试你走向解决方案的方式。完全占据每种注意力状态并在两者之间流畅地移动，你可以创造和解的可能性。

From the Smush, you can't do anything at all.

从挤压中，你什么也做不了。

As you practice, you will find that sometimes your language will be well directed while your attention wavers, or that your attention is out on the other person like a laser, but that you've slid into asking self-referential questions, which we associate with submissive language.

当你练习时，你会发现有时你的语言会被很好地引导，而你的注意力在摇摆，或者你的注意力像激光一样向外投射到另一个人身上，但你已经滑入了问自我参照的问题，我们将其与顺从语言联系在一起。

But if you keep working with your language and attention over a sustained interaction, you will feel a shift. You'll know that you're succeeding the very same way that a dog trainer or professional dominatrix does—the other person's body will loosen as they move into a more submissive space. Their eyes will soften. Their shoulders will drop. They might sigh a little or lean toward you. You will start seeing your words land in their body.

但如果你在持续的互动中继续使用你的语言和注意力，你会感觉到转变。你会知道你在成功，就像狗训练师或专业女支配者一样——另一个人的身体会在他们进入更顺从的空间时放松。他们的眼睛会软化。他们的肩膀会下降。他们可能会稍微叹息或向你倾斜。你将开始看到你的话落在他们的身体上。

When a domme is completely seated in her energetic authority, her sub can relax.

当女支配者完全坐稳在她的能量权威中时，她的被支配者可以放松。

You reward that trust by keeping your attention out and guiding the action, determining what comes next. A relaxed, effortless intuition will kick in: Without conscious thought, you will know what to say, and how, in order to lead your sub. In the present, moment by moment, you will feel and be able to pursue signs of what's alive in the other person. Following those signs dictates what's next. It's an open-book test, and they are the book—everything you need to know is right there.

你通过保持注意力向外并引导行动，决定接下来会发生什么来奖励这种信任。一种放松的、毫不费力的直觉会启动：不需要有意识的思考，你将知道该说什么，以及如何说，以便引导你的被支配者。在当下，每时每刻，你会感受到并能够追求另一个人中活着的迹象。跟随这些迹象决定了接下来会发生什么。这是一个开卷考试，他们就是书——你需要知道的一切都在那里。

This is where influence begins.

这就是影响力开始的地方。
