## The Difference between Knowing and Knowing | 知道与真正知道的区别

Case closed!

案子结束了！

Good Girl conditioning leads to the Smush, which leads to incongruence—an inability to occupy either the submissive or the dominant position completely. The Smush makes it difficult for us to give an instruction or to speak our truths in a way that feels good to the person we're communicating with.

好女孩的条件反射导致了挤压，这导致了不一致——无法完全占据顺从或支配的位置。挤压使我们难以以对我们正在交流的人感觉良好的方式给出指示或说出我们的真相。

So all we have to do is be congruent—completely occupy the dominant or the submissive state when we're asking for something or giving an order—and voilà! We arrive at the life force. Problem solved. Go forth and conquer, ladies.

所以我们要做的就是保持一致——在要求某物或发出命令时完全占据支配或顺从状态——然后，瞧！我们到达了生命力。问题解决了。去吧，征服吧，女士们。

It really is that simple. But it's not quite that easy—something I'm keenly aware of, after working with thousands of badass women in the laboratory provided to me by our school.

它真的就是这么简单。但这并不那么容易——在我们学校为我提供的实验室里与数千名坚强的女性合作后，我敏锐地意识到了这一点。

Again, my students aren't shrinking violets, damsels in distress. They have impressive jobs and families, and operate with tremendous power in many areas of their lives. And yet, what I see repeatedly—even with huge celebrities, even with CEOs—is that women need training to get their attention out.

再次，我的学生不是羞怯的紫罗兰，也不是遇难的少女。她们有令人印象深刻的工作和家庭，在生活的许多领域都拥有巨大的权力。然而，我反复看到的是——即使是大名人，即使是首席执行官——女性需要训练才能将注意力向外转。

"Show me an eight on the anger scale," I say to Nkechi; I happen to know that more than a thousand people report to her at work. "Get mad!" Then I ask the room how she's showing up. They lovingly but honestly rate her first attempt at a two or three. I jump in: "Tell him exactly how you feel about what he did. Don't stop until his balls are hanging off your belt!" Her next attempt is a five. The male volunteer, by the way, is standing in for the man who molested her kid; if she could tap into the molten core of lava-like rage that everyone in the room can feel running just under her immaculate surface, I'd probably be arrested for endangering him. As it is, it takes us about ten minutes of cajoling and encouraging to get her up to a very civilized eight.

"给我看愤怒量表的八分，"我对恩凯奇说；我碰巧知道在工作中有超过一千人向她汇报。"生气！"然后我问房间里的人她的表现如何。他们充满爱心但诚实地将她第一次尝试评为两分或三分。我插话："告诉他你对他的行为的确切感受。不要停止，直到他的蛋蛋挂在你腰带上！"她的下一次尝试是五分。顺便说一句，这位男性志愿者代表的是猥亵她孩子的那个人；如果她能够进入房间里的每个人都能感觉到在她完美表面下流淌的熔岩般的愤怒核心，我可能会因危及他而被捕。实际上，我们花了大约十分钟的哄劝和鼓励才让她达到一个非常文明的八分。

"Penetrate his space," I tell Lucia, who runs her complicated household like a brilliant military campaign. "Dominate him. Violate his boundaries; get in there." She's told me privately that she worries about being too strong, too much for the people in her life. But it's only when she's in a room full of supportive women, whooping and whistling encouragement, with me modeling how to straddle the volunteer and shove a riding crop into his chest, that she is even able to tiptoe over the line into a state approximating real dominance.

"穿透他的空间，"我告诉露西亚，她像一场出色的军事行动一样管理她复杂的家庭。"支配他。侵犯他的边界；进去。"她私下告诉我，她担心自己太强大，对她生活中的人来说太多了。但只有当她在一个充满支持女性的房间里，她们欢呼和吹口哨鼓励，我示范如何跨坐在志愿者身上并将马鞭插入他的胸膛时，她才能够踮着脚尖越过界限进入接近真正支配的状态。

When I'm teaching Turning the Spotlight, I say to the room, "I'm going to ask one of you an uncomfortable question. No matter what: Don't answer my question. Instead, put your attention out—on me—and ask me one back."

当我教授"转向聚光灯"时，我对房间里的人说，"我要问你们其中一个一个不舒服的问题。无论如何：不要回答我的问题。相反，把你的注意力向外转——放在我身上——然后问我一个问题。"

Despite my explicit direction not to answer my question, the first woman I hand the mic to answers the question I've asked her, Good Girl auto-responder in full effect. The whole room erupts in laughter. Even so, the second woman answers me, too. Sometimes it can take three or four tries for someone to ask me a question back instead of reflexively answering the one I've asked. Almost no one, before they have trained, can truly turn the spotlight back on me, putting me on the spot.

尽管我明确指示不要回答我的问题，但我递给麦克风的第一位女性回答了我问她的问题，好女孩自动应答器完全生效。整个房间爆发出笑声。即便如此，第二位女性也回答了我。有时可能需要三四次尝试才能让某人问我一个问题，而不是反射性地回答我问的问题。几乎没有人，在训练之前，能够真正将聚光灯转回我身上，让我处于聚光灯下。

These students know all about dominant and submissive states of attention. They know all about the Smush and the compression that female conditioning brings. But they can't do it yet; they can't achieve congruence by fully occupying one state or another.

这些学生知道所有关于支配和顺从的注意力状态。她们知道所有关于挤压和女性条件反射带来的压迫。但她们还不能做到；她们无法通过完全占据一种或另一种状态来实现一致性。

The reason why has everything to do with women's default state of attention, another facet in the difference between the conditioning that men and women receive.

原因与女性注意力的默认状态有关，这是男性和女性接受的 conditioning 差异的另一个方面。

### How We Reward Billy and Mary | 我们如何奖励比利和玛丽

I should say up front that I have zero interest in a biological cast on this material; I'm not a scientist here to argue nature versus nurture, and I have absolutely no idea what the fundamental differences are between men and women, if indeed they exist at all.

我应该提前说明，我对这个材料的生物学解释毫无兴趣；我不是来这里争论先天与后天的科学家，我完全不知道男性和女性之间的根本区别是什么，如果真的存在的话。

But I am faced every day with the consequences of the differences in how boys and girls are educated to move through the world, and these absolutely are gendered.

但我每天都面临着男孩和女孩如何被教育在世界中移动的差异后果，这些绝对是性别的。

Take two kids, a boy and a girl: we'll call them Billy and Mary. Even when they are very young, are Billy and Mary rewarded for the same types of behaviors?

拿两个孩子，一个男孩和一个女孩：我们叫他们比利和玛丽。即使在他们很小的时候，比利和玛丽会因为相同类型的行为而受到奖励吗？

They are not.

他们不是。

Billy is rewarded and punished for what he does when his attention is out. "Look what Billy did! Look what Billy made! Do you believe what Billy said?" Whereas Mary is rewarded when the attention—hers and others'—is placed on her. "Look at Mary's pretty dress! Doesn't she have lovely manners? Isn't she sweet?"

比利因为他在注意力向外时所做的事情而受到奖励和惩罚。"看看比利做了什么！看看比利做了什么！你相信比利说的话吗？"而玛丽在注意力——她自己的和他人的——放在她身上时受到奖励。"看看玛丽的漂亮裙子！她没有可爱的举止吗？她不是甜美的吗？"

From the very start, then, boys are rewarded for agency—for what they do—while girls are rewarded for how they are. Boys are verbs; girls are nouns.

从一开始，男孩就因为能动性——他们所做的——而受到奖励，而女孩则因为她们的样子而受到奖励。男孩是动词；女孩是名词。

The world is changing, and for the better. But for many of us who are adult women now, this pattern was in place when we were learning how to be people: we were rewarded for attention in.

世界正在改变，而且变得更好。但对于我们许多现在成年女性的人来说，这种模式在我们学习如何做人时就存在了：我们因为注意力向内而受到奖励。

### For Women, the Default State of Attention Is In | 对女性来说，注意力的默认状态是向内

In many cases, women's ease with "attention in" manifests as an attunement to an inner signal—the much vaunted women's intuition—or a refinement in taste. This sensitivity to subtlety is a result of how we are educated, from our earliest days. It is also why we are prone to freezing: when a woman is put on the spot, she stays on the spot, because that's what she has been trained to do—to put her attention inward. This both makes us more susceptible to speechlessness and makes it harder for us to break out of it.

在许多情况下，女性对"注意力向内"的轻松表现为对内在信号的调谐——备受吹捧的女性直觉——或品味的精致。这种对微妙之处的敏感性是我们从最早的日子开始接受教育的结果。这也是为什么我们容易冻结：当女性被置于聚光灯下时，她停留在聚光灯下，因为这就是她被训练要做的事情——将注意力向内转。这既使我们更容易陷入无言，也使我们更难摆脱它。

What we are not trained to do is turn our attention out. Indeed, women often take a disproportionate amount of heat for what happens when they turn their attention out. Think about the classroom: boys are generally expected to misbehave, but it's shocking when a girl runs amok.

我们没有训练去做的是将注意力向外转。事实上，当女性将注意力向外转时，她们往往承担了不成比例的热度。想想教室：男孩通常被期望行为不端，但当女孩失控时，这是令人震惊的。

Nor does this conditioning stop in childhood. How do we as a culture discuss politicians and celebrities when they act out? A man's behavior is forgivable, even when it's questionable: "That Billy sure is an asshole, but he gets things done." Mary's achievements, on the other hand, remain invisible—even while she's being called a ruthless bitch.

这种条件反射也不会在童年停止。作为一个文化，当政治家和名人行为不端时，我们如何讨论他们？一个男人的行为是可以原谅的，即使是有问题的："那个比利确实是个混蛋，但他把事情做好了。"另一方面，玛丽的成就仍然不可见——即使她被称为无情的婊子。

Our culture is obsessed with what men do, and who women are.

我们的文化痴迷于男人做什么，以及女人是谁。

This default state of "attention in" is a big deal when it comes to power dynamics. Your ability to successfully influence someone may require you to turn and keep your attention out—that's what dominance is. Because of what we know about Billy's upbringing, this state of attention turned out may very well be a more comfortable state of being for him; after all, he's been training for it since he was in diapers.

当涉及权力动态时，这种"注意力向内"的默认状态是一件大事。你成功影响某人的能力可能要求你转向并保持注意力向外——这就是支配。因为我们对比利成长经历的了解，这种注意力向外的状态对他来说很可能是一种更舒适的存在状态；毕竟，他从穿尿布的时候就开始训练了。

Women don't have that advantage. They can and do learn it, but we're bringing centuries of conditioning to the project. Old habits die hard—not to mention that we can't always tell with 100 percent accuracy what our bodies are really saying. All most of us know is that we don't get the response we want, as often as we should.

女性没有这种优势。她们可以而且确实学会了这一点，但我们将几个世纪的条件反射带入这个项目。旧习惯很难改——更不用说我们不能总是百分之百准确地知道我们的身体真正在说什么。我们大多数人所知道的只是我们没有得到我们想要的回应，像我们应该的那样经常。

The beauty of understanding power dynamics as "attention out, attention in" is that it renders them gender-neutral. We don't need to drag the past into the future, but we do have to see clearly what has taken place in the past, especially all the ways it affects our present.

将权力动态理解为"注意力向外，注意力向内"的美妙之处在于，它使它们变得性别中立。我们不需要把过去拖到未来，但我们确实必须清楚地看到过去发生的事情，特别是它影响我们现在的所有方式。

This is why we train.

这就是为什么我们训练。

It takes training for women to be able to put their attention out, and it takes a lot of training for them to learn to keep it out. That training involves practice, yes. But it also means breaking the compression of the Smush in other ways, which is precisely what we will be doing in the exercises in the second part of this book.

女性需要训练才能将注意力向外转，她们需要大量训练才能学会保持它向外。这种训练涉及练习，是的。但它也意味着以其他方式打破挤压的压迫，这正是我们将在本书第二部分练习中做的事情。

### Not Just Why, but How | 不仅仅是为什么，而是如何

I don't want to settle for merely revealing the invisible landscape of what we're up against, and I don't want you to settle for that, either.

我不想仅仅满足于揭示我们面临的看不见的风景，我也不想让你满足于此。

Yes, seeing the conversation under the conversation can make a huge difference in how you move through the world, but that insight alone won't bring about the radical shift you seek. Women come to me all the time with great and powerful insights about the problems they face, but it's only after they've broken the gendered compression and incongruence of the Smush and their tendency to get trapped in a default, submissive, attention-in state of attention that they are able to use the insights they have.

是的，看到对话下的对话可以让你在世界中的移动方式产生巨大的不同，但仅仅这种洞察不会带来你寻求的激进转变。女性一直来找我，带着关于她们面临的问题的伟大而强大的洞察，但只有在她们打破了挤压的性别压迫和不一致以及她们陷入默认、顺从、注意力向内的注意力状态的倾向后，她们才能使用她们拥有的洞察。

This is where the title of this book comes from. The ability to skillfully participate in influential conversations is the key to changing the world as we know it. My mission is to unbind you from the gendered patterning that stops your speech or makes it less effective than it should and can be.

这就是这本书标题的来源。熟练参与有影响力的对话的能力是改变我们所知世界的关键。我的使命是让你从阻止你说话或使其不如它应该和能够有效的那样有效的性别模式中解脱出来。

The exercises that follow will show you how to break that gendered compression in an embodied way. Intellectually understanding a concept does not mean it will be right there for you to use when you need it most. This is what I want for you: reflexive, instinctive access that goes beyond mere knowledge, the difference between knowing how to play tennis and knowing how to play tennis the way Serena Williams knows how to play tennis.

接下来的练习将向你展示如何以具身化的方式打破那种性别压迫。在智力上理解一个概念并不意味着它会在你最需要的时候为你所用。这就是我想要的：超越仅仅知识的反射性、本能性访问，知道如何打网球和知道如何像塞雷娜·威廉姆斯知道如何打网球一样打网球之间的区别。

Plus, the compression of the Smush that gives rise to incongruence happens in your body. So a cerebral understanding of how to break it won't touch it; you have to feel it.

此外，导致不一致的挤压压迫发生在你的身体中。所以对如何打破它的脑力理解不会触及它；你必须感受它。

You will not need to police yourself for congruence. Do the exercises in this book, and this unbinding will happen naturally. You may find that I am pushing you to the extremes of too much and too little. We are doing this to break this ancient compression, the agent of inner censorship, one that no longer serves us in this new century. Allow yourself to imagine and feel the outer extremes of some of these exercises, and you will find not the middle path, but your own unique voice: sometimes ruthless, sometimes nurturing, but always powerful and precisely calibrated to the situation at hand.

你不需要为自己监管一致性。做这本书中的练习，这种解脱会自然发生。你可能会发现我正在把你推向太多和太少的极端。我们这样做是为了打破这种古老的压迫，内在审查的代理人，一个在这个新世纪不再为我们服务的东西。允许自己想象和感受这些练习中一些的外在极端，你会发现不是中间道路，而是你自己独特的声音：有时无情，有时养育，但总是强大并精确校准到手头的情况。

This embodiment is what sets this book apart from the thousands of others that exquisitely detail the problem, get you all fired up, and ultimately leave you wondering why everything you've learned doesn't work. When "why" stalls out, "how" needs to pick up the ball and score the goal.

这种具身化是这本书与成千上万其他详细阐述问题、让你兴奋、最终让你想知道为什么你学到的一切都不起作用的书的区别。当"为什么"停滞不前时，"如何"需要拿起球并得分。

Usually, what the Good Girl does is try harder. Losing weight, getting pregnant, getting a new job, even being more powerful!—a Good Girl can be counted on to do it the way it's supposed to be done. And when that doesn't work, she grits her teeth and doubles down, doing the same thing, only with more effort—which makes it more painful when it doesn't work.

通常，好女孩做的是更加努力。减肥、怀孕、找新工作，甚至变得更强大！——好女孩可以指望以应该做的方式做到。当那不起作用时，她咬紧牙关加倍努力，做同样的事情，只是更加努力——当它不起作用时，这使它更加痛苦。

In the next section, I will suggest a different course, driven by curiosity: imagination over effort.

在下一节中，我将建议一个不同的课程，由好奇心驱动：想象力胜过努力。

One of our students permanently lost fifty pounds by having every morsel of her food prepared and fed to her by adoring men. Another one left her job, asked for it back, got turned away, and ended up running the company and firing her old boss. A student no longer attracted to her husband because she was tired of being the primary breadwinner sent him to sex school. The two of them are now renowned Tantra teachers, traveling the world and, in their sixties, having the best sex of their lives.

我们的一个学生通过让爱慕她的男人准备和喂食她的每一口食物而永久减掉了五十磅。另一个离开了她的工作，要求回来，被拒绝了，最终经营公司并解雇了她的老老板。一个学生不再被她丈夫吸引，因为她厌倦了成为主要养家糊口的人，送他去性学校。他们两人现在是著名的坦陀罗老师，环游世界，在六十多岁时，拥有他们一生中最好的性爱。

None of these solutions came out of the grind; they came from inspiration, by-products of imagination, creativity, experimentation, and ingenuity.

这些解决方案都不是从苦干中产生的；它们来自灵感，想象力、创造力、实验和独创性的副产品。

They came from following the life force.

它们来自跟随生命力。

Ultimately, this is the goal: that vital feeling of being fully awake. This is why we have to shed our Good Girl bondage and the compression that comes along with it. This goes past congruence and the ability to communicate in a clean way. In a contracted state, it is not only difficult to fully access power, but it's hard to feel fully alive.

最终，这就是目标：完全清醒的活力感。这就是为什么我们必须摆脱好女孩的束缚和随之而来的压迫。这超越了一致性和以干净的方式沟通的能力。在收缩状态下，不仅难以完全获得权力，而且很难感受到完全活着。

This has nothing to do with right and wrong—those judgments tend to be cultural and situational. I prefer a much more personal, embodied code: what is alive and what is not.

这与对错无关——这些判断往往是文化和情境的。我更喜欢一个更个人化、具身化的代码：什么是活的，什么不是。

Not only do I want you to exercise great care to protect and nourish the life force, but I want you to hunt the life force in everyone and everything you encounter. You will place your attention on it, get curious about it, find what's sexy and alive and energized, and do what you can to explore and expand that, creating heightened and electrified situations.

我不仅希望你非常小心地保护和滋养生命力，而且我希望你在遇到的每个人和每件事中寻找生命力。你会把注意力放在它上面，对它感到好奇，找到性感、活力和充满活力的东西，并尽你所能探索和扩展它，创造高度和电击的情况。

Whether it's choosing a relationship or a piece of art or which side to take in an argument about politics, we train ourselves to be vitality barometers. Sometimes what's dead can look really good—safe, tried and true, "realistic." But the wisdom of experience shows us that the path always peters out; following it depletes us, leaves us with less and less energy. Logical or not, a woman who is truly standing in her power will always choose the option that burns brightest, the one that fills her body with energy and expansion.

无论是选择一段关系还是一件艺术品，还是在政治争论中站在哪一边，我们训练自己成为活力晴雨表。有时死的东西看起来真的很好——安全、经过验证的、"现实的"。但经验的智慧向我们表明，这条路总是会枯竭；跟随它消耗我们，让我们越来越少的能量。逻辑与否，一个真正站在自己权力中的女人总是会选择燃烧最亮的选项，那个让她的身体充满能量和扩展的选项。

As a teacher, I witness daily what happens when women start to see the invisible bondage we've inherited. I see the radical, transformative acts of love and creativity women are capable of when we can identify and speak what we want. This is what I'm interested in: your highest vision—for yourself, for women, for the planet. I want to know what lights you up, what sets you ablaze, what makes you feel most alive.

作为一名教师，我每天都目睹当女性开始看到我们继承的看不见的束缚时会发生什么。我看到当我们可以识别和说出我们想要的东西时，女性能够做的激进、变革性的爱和创造力的行为。这就是我感兴趣的：你最高的愿景——为你自己，为女性，为地球。我想知道什么让你发光，什么让你燃烧，什么让你感觉最活着。

That is what will deliver you to your own, unique destiny, and that's good for everybody.

这就是将带你到达你自己独特的命运的东西，这对每个人都有好处。

When you play skillfully with power dynamics, the world changes. You stop being a servant of the life you're living and become a creator of the world you want.

当你熟练地与权力动态游戏时，世界会改变。你不再是生活的仆人，而成为你想要世界的创造者。
