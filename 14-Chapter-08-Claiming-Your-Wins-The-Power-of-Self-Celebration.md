# Chapter 08: Claiming Your Wins| 第八章：为自己喝彩

## The Power of Self-Celebration | 肯定自己的力量

My student Sasha tells me that she's stuck—scattered, disorganized, always late. I try to get to the root of the desire behind her complaints, but no dice: when she does the exercises designed to unleash her suppressed rage, the only person she's angry with is herself.

我的学生萨沙跟我说，她现在特别迷茫——总是心不在焉，生活一团糟，还老迟到。我想了解她抱怨背后的真正原因，但没什么用：让她做那些释放内心愤怒的练习时，她反而更生自己的气。

"My entire life is defined by my absolute failure to get anything done, or done on time. And I can't fix the problem because I can't focus."

"我觉得自己就是个彻头彻尾的失败者，什么事都做不好，还总是拖拖拉拉。可我就是改不了，因为我根本静不下心来。"

God, I love a stubborn woman.

天哪，我就喜欢这种倔强的女人。

Instead of leading her down a path where she can slam on the brakes at every turn, I point out: she was focused enough to formulate the question, and she did get to class on time. "How many of those little victories do you notice over the course of a given day?" I ask her.

我没有硬要她改变，而是告诉她：她已经足够专注在问题上了，而且她还按时上课了。"一天下来，你觉得自己能注意到多少这样的小胜利？"我问她。

"I'm supposed to celebrate being able to ask a question? That's pathetic."

"我就该为能提出一个问题而庆祝吗？真是太悲哀了。"

Fine—it's pathetic. Nevertheless, I lead her through a self-celebration exercise where she homes in on the victories of the day, including asking the question. Because every time Sasha tells herself she is a chaotic mess of a human being, she is reinforcing the exact behaviors she wishes to be released from.

也许是有点悲哀。不过我还是引导她进行了一个自我庆祝的练习，让她一一回顾当天的胜利，包括提出的那些问题。因为每当萨莎告诉自己她是个混乱的人的时候，也正是在强化她想去改变的动力。

"Do you remember the moment today that you realized it was time to leave for class?"

"你还记得今天自己意识到该去上课的时刻吗？"我问道。

She says, "Yeah, but I messed around for another five minutes before I got up to go."

"记得，不过我又拖延了五分钟才终于起身走了。"她回答道。

"Take a moment," I say, "to note that you knew when it was time to leave, messed around for another five, and got here on time anyway."

"别着急，"我说，"注意，你知道什么时候该走，尽管磨蹭了五分钟，但你还是按时到达了。"

It is crucial for Sasha—for all of us—to register evidence of when we got it right. Men do it all the time—how many "big fish" pictures have you seen in your life? And yet, over and over, I see women achieve a 97 percent victory—and then focus all of their attention on the 3 percent that didn't land.

对于萨沙——以及我们所有人——来说，至关重要的是要记录下我们做对了的地方。男性往往会这样做——你见过多少展示"大鱼"的照片？然而，我屡屡发现，女性即使取得了97%的胜利，却往往只专注于那3%的失败。

This is a mistake, and not just because self-punishment as a form of behavior change very rarely works, but because of the imprint it leaves. That focus on the missing 3 percent virtually guarantees that a woman will continue to identify as someone who never gets it right.

这是一个误区，因为自我惩罚几乎不会有效改变行为，反而还会留下深远的负面影响。沉溺于那3%的错误会让女性觉得她们永远做不好。

Focusing on the triumphant 97 percent does exactly the opposite; it cements your understanding of yourself as the kind of person who is capable of making your own dreams come true. Self-celebration reinforces the idea—it sends a message to yourself—that you can trust what you want, and that you can trust yourself to make good things happen for yourself.

然而，关注那97%的胜利会带来截然不同的结果：它能让你更加意识到自己有能力实现梦想。自我庆祝能够强化这一意识——传达一个关键信息：你能信任自己的愿望，也能相信自己有能力为自己创造美好未来。

Self-celebration dispels shame. It helps you trust that you are good.

自我庆祝能够缓解羞愧感，使你更加确信自己的优秀。

---

I'm not kidding: I think female self-celebration is the cure for the patriarchy. But it's not always easy to see what this has to do with power—in fact, it's the step that the women who come to me looking for shortcuts are most likely to skip. But when you build your library of wins, you strengthen your attunement to your inner signal and reinforce what that win felt like for you, in your body—which changes how you choose in the future.

我不是在开玩笑：我坚信，女性学会自我庆祝是治疗传统观念束缚的一个良方。但理解这种做法与权力的关系确实不容易——事实上，凡是来找我的女性，最可能忽视的就是这一环节。然而，当你建立起属于自己的胜利宝库时，你就会增强对内心信号的感知力，并强化胜利带给你的感受——这将对你未来的选择产生重要影响。

#### The Good Girl's Propensity to Self-Attack | 好女孩的自我攻击倾向

One of the most insidious by-products of the patriarchy is the isolation that makes it feel like every woman's problem is personal and psychological—as opposed to systemic and sociological.

传统观念的一个副作用，就是让女性觉得自己的问题都是个人原因，是心理问题，而不是社会大环境造成的。

The danger with this category error is that it leads to self-attack.

这种错误的归类非常危险，因为它可能导致我们对自己攻击。

This is a Good Girl problem. The Good Girl is lovely to others—polite, solicitous, forgiving, and generous to a fault. But she is fucking vicious with herself.

这就是所谓的"好女孩"困境。好女孩倾向于对他人非常亲切——举止得体、有礼貌、宽容大度。但是，她们对自己却十分苛刻。

This habit of self-attack is so common that it's invisible to most of us. It's not just the endless, relentless mental chatter, the "God, I can't believe I just said that" or "I could never wear that dress." It's the downplaying and discounting we do all the time—the way my student told me she went to college in California instead of saying she graduated cum laude from Stanford; the way another student returned a compliment about her sweater by telling me she'd bought it on sale; how we talk about our promotions and commendations and accomplishments like we got lucky, and anyway, the committee was probably drunk.

这种自我攻击的习惯太常见了，常见到大多数人都没意识到自己在这么做。它不仅仅是无休止的、无情的内心喋喋不休，比如"天哪，我不敢相信我刚才说了那句话"或"我绝对不能穿那条裙子"。它还包括我们不断地贬低和忽视自己的行为——比如我的一个学生告诉我她在加州上大学，而不是说她以优异成绩从斯坦福大学毕业；另一个学生在回应别人称赞她的毛衣时，说她是在打折时买的；我们谈论自己的升职、表彰和成就时，总是说自己运气好，或者反正评审委员会可能喝醉了。

Give a woman a compliment, and often, she'll argue with you! It sometimes seems that there is no victory—no amazing relationship or new baby or rediscovered passion or professional triumph—that a woman cannot use against herself in this game of constant, perpetual diminishment we're engaged in.

赞美一个女人时，她常常会反驳你！有时，似乎在我们所参与的这场永无止境的、自贬的游戏中，没有什么胜利能够让女人用来对抗自己——无论是令人惊叹的关系、刚刚降生的婴儿、重新点燃的激情，还是职业上的巨大成功。

This is even true about what I teach. My students don't say, "Holy shit! I'm going to burn down the world with what I've learned here." They say, "I have so much regret for all the time I wasted! I'm so stupid for not figuring this out earlier."

我的教学情形也是这样。我的学生从来不说："哇！我会用这里学到的东西去改变世界"。她们会说："我真后悔浪费了那么多时间！我真蠢，为什么没早些明白呢？"

In class, that wound is immediately healed because invariably, another woman in the room chimes in: "Ugh, I feel that way, too." In isolation, though, Good Girl conditioning scrambles our internal compasses. It tells us that there's nothing worse than a mother who doesn't feel like spending every single minute with her little angels, unless it's a woman who leaves the house without makeup, a woman who doesn't care if she ever gets married, a woman who doesn't want to work.

在课堂上，这种痛苦会迅速消散，因为总有另一位女性会表示认同："唉，我也有同感"。然而，当我们孤身一人时，"好女孩"的本能会使我们内心摇摆。它告诉我们，没有什么比一个不愿意每分每秒都陪伴自己小天使的母亲更糟糕的了，除非是一个不化妆就出门的女人，一个不在乎是否结婚的女人，或者一个不想工作的女人。

Good Girl–colored glasses are why we feel so out of step when we guiltily want things that we shouldn't want, or don't want what the culture tells us we should. "What's wrong with me?" we wonder, walking that impossible tightrope. But there's nothing wrong with us; we've simply been trained to think that there is.

当我们对"不应得到"的东西感到内疚，或者抗拒文化告诉我们"应该追求"的东西时，"好女孩"的有色眼镜让我们感到不合拍。我们如履薄冰般质问自己："我到底哪里出问题了？"其实，我们没有问题，只是被教导得误以为自己有问题。

We come by this habit of self-attack honestly. Our default state of attention, remember, is in—and most of us were trained to use that attention in to monitor and police ourselves. This was a gift from our foremothers, who were reflecting their own truths: that the tallest blade of grass is the one cut first, that the one in the shortest skirt is "asking for it," that the squeakiest wheel stays unmarried in the best-case scenario—and is stoned or burned at the stake, in the worst. For the women who came before us, these Good Girl accommodations were survival skills. When they told us, "Watch yourself closely," it was because they were trying to keep us safe, physically and otherwise.

我们诚实地继承了这种自我攻击的习惯。别忘了，我们大多数人从一开始就被教导要用注意力来监视自己——很多时候是无意识的。这是我们的前辈女性留给我们的礼物，这反映了她们自己的真实经历：最高的草被最先割掉，穿最短裙子的女孩是在"自找麻烦"，而那个"最响的轮子"在最好的情况下会孤独终老，而在最糟糕的情况下可能被砸死或烧死在火刑柱上。对于前辈女性而言，保持"好女孩"姿态是一种生存策略。她们当初反复告诫我们"密切注意自己"其实是出于保护我们的安全——不仅在身体层面，还有其他方面。

We can be grateful for the gift they gave us, even as we acknowledge that these skills no longer serve. In fact, we can now see how this originally protective hand-me-down now works against us—because of the effect it has not just on our self-esteem, but on our communication and subsequent access to power and influence.

即使我们承认这些技能不再有用，我们仍可以感激她们赠予我们的礼物。事实上，我们现在可以看到，这种最初用于保护的传承如今却对我们不利——不仅影响我们的自尊，还影响我们的沟通能力以及随之而来的能量和影响力。

Just as attention turned out without instruction isn't dominance, attention turned in so we can self-police is not a true expression of the submissive state of attention. Submission is a deeply felt connection to the truth of who you are right now—today. When you're monitoring yourself, you're still reflecting some percentage of your attention out, onto what others are thinking about you, and what they're likely to do or say about it.

正如未经引导的向外的注意力不具有主导性，用于自我约束的向内的注意力也不是真正的顺从状态的表现。顺从是一种对当下（今天）真实自我的深层连接。当你在监控自己时，你仍然会把一部分注意力投向外界，关注别人对你的看法，以及他们可能会做什么或说什么上。

This incomplete occupation of the submissive state is why, despite our default state of attention (in), we're still so starved for it. Attention in, when it's critical or self-policing, strips the nutrients out of what should be the luxurious surrender of the submissive. There's nothing rejuvenating or regenerative about turning your attention inward in a critical way—especially because self-attack usually leads to invisible labor: resolutions to work out more, to drink more water, to take better notes, to set up an automatic savings plan, to dress better, to start making your own organic applesauce. . . .

这种不完整的顺从状态占据了我们默认的注意力状态（向内的），这也是为什么尽管我们本能地倾向于向内注意力，却仍然感到极度渴望。当向内的注意力变成批判或自我监视时，它剥夺了应该属于顺从状态的那种奢侈的放松。以批判的方式将注意力转向内心并不会带来任何恢复活力或再生的效果——尤其是因为自我攻击通常会导致隐形劳动：决心多锻炼、多喝水、做更好的笔记、制定自动储蓄计划、穿得更好、开始自己制作有机苹果酱……

Thus, self-policing leaves you both undernourished by the submissive state and bleeding out the other way.

因此，自我监视既让你无法从顺从状态中获得营养，又让你在另一种方式中流失。

The antidote to this is a dose of self-celebration. In a culture where women are taught to turn their attention in for the purpose of criticizing themselves, it's deeply healing to use that same impulse to commend ourselves instead. This is especially important in the wake of trauma or disappointment or heartbreak. It's breathtaking to defy our inherited superstitions and to discover that we are, in fact, no less safe when we abandon self-criticism and self-attack.

对此的解药是一剂自我庆祝。在一种教导女性将注意力转向内心以批判自己的文化中，利用同样的冲动来表扬自己是一种深刻的疗愈方式。这在经历创伤、失望或心碎之后尤为重要。挑战我们继承的迷信并发现，当我们放弃自我批评和自我攻击时，我们实际上并不因此而少了安全感，这种体验令人惊叹。

#### Celebrate Yourself—and Each Other | 庆祝自己——以及彼此

Another radical concept: it's important to celebrate our triumphs with others.

另一个激进的概念：与他人一起庆祝我们的胜利是很重要的。

Here, of course, we bump heads with our Good Girl conditioning: a Good Girl doesn't trumpet her victories, but obsesses over everything she's done wrong, more fully sealing in a feeling of powerlessness, even if she's just making herself small for the sake of the herd. It's not accidental that there isn't a single shared space in our culture (and do not say Instagram) where women can say, "I'm fucking amazing."

当然，这里我们会与"好女孩"的本能发生冲突：好女孩不会大肆宣扬自己的胜利，而是纠结于自己做错的一切，更加巩固了无力感，即使她只是为了群体而让自己显得渺小。我们文化中没有一个共享空间（不要说Instagram）可以让女性说："我真他妈的了不起。"

It's incredibly taboo to do this! And yet it's essential.

这样做是非常禁忌的！然而，这却是至关重要的。

For this and other reasons, I recommend that you form a Mistress group. (For more information about how to do that, see \h .)

出于这个和其他原因，我建议你组建一个女主人小组。（关于如何组建，请参见相关章节。）

The other reasons first: at its heart, this training is about power dynamics, and the best way to explore a dynamic is through interaction, especially because this is a body-based practice. Much of what we discuss will require that you be able to read what's going on in someone else's body, and that's hard to know if you're working in isolation.

先说其他原因：这项训练的核心是能量动态，探索动态的最佳方式是通过互动，特别是因为这是一个基于身体的练习。我们讨论的许多内容都需要你能够读懂他人身体的反应，这是你独自一人时很难做到。

This is why the exercises work so well in class, even when they feel like playacting. If you ask someone for something in a way that makes her want to slap your stupid face, even if she's playing along, in the split second before she recovers enough to laugh it off, she'll flinch. This is the amazing thing about energetics: the body doesn't lie.

这就是为什么这些练习在课堂上的效果很好，即使感觉像是在演戏。如果你以一种让别人想打你一巴掌的方式向她提出要求，即使她在配合，在她回过神来一笑置之之前的一瞬间，她也会退缩。这就是能量学的神奇之处：身体不会撒谎。

These clues are how you will know your influence is working; they are how you will tell whether it's time to retreat or to push further. In order to get good at reading these reactions, you will have to practice, and a Mistress group will give you the chance to do that.

这些线索是你知道自己影响力是否奏效的方式；它们是你判断是否该撤退或进一步推进的依据。为了熟练掌握这些反应，你需要练习，而女主人小组会给你这样的机会。

If there has been any silver lining to the political garbage fire of the past few years, it has been watching women show up for one another. Women act as catalysts for each other all the time in my classes. "I want X," a student says, and the woman next to her realizes she wants that too. Even better, she repeats her fellow Mistress's dream back to her, amplified, improved, greedier—better. Sometimes we dream better for others than we do for ourselves.

如果说过去几年政治垃圾大火中有任何一线希望，那就是看到女性彼此支持。在我的课堂上，女性一直充当彼此的催化剂。"我想要这个，"一个学生说，旁边的女性意识到她也想要这个。更妙的是，她将同伴的梦想重复给她听，放大、改进、更加贪婪——更好。有时我们为他人做梦比为自己做得更好。

But your Mistress group can become an important site for self-celebration. Read your Victory Logs to each other. (This makes for a wonderful opening ritual.) Or start a WhatsApp group, as many of my students do, where you all post your celebrations. When you hear someone else celebrating themselves, join the party. Repeat what you heard them say, and tell them how good it felt for you to hear a woman declaring that she did something really cool. Tell them what you see.

你的女主人小组可以成为一个重要的自我庆祝场所。互相读出你的胜利日志。（这可以成为一个美妙的开场仪式。）或者像我的许多学生一样，创建一个WhatsApp小组，大家在里面发布自己的庆祝。当你听到别人庆祝自己时，加入派对。重复你听到她们说的话，告诉她们听到一个女人宣称自己做了很酷的事情让你感觉多么好。告诉她们你看到了什么。

The only difference between envy and inspiration is connection.

嫉妒与灵感之间的唯一区别就是连接。

By honoring yourself in the presence of other women, you're teaching other women to honor themselves in yours.

通过在其他女性面前尊重自己，你也在教导其他女性在你面前尊重自己。

A note about the word "mistress": Mistress is the title a dominatrix often uses; that's not why we use it. And a mistress can be a homewrecker, the agent of infidelity; that's definitely not why we use it. We use it because it's the feminine form of the word "master."

关于"女主人"这个词的说明：女主人是女统治者常用的称呼，但我们使用它并不是这个原因。女主人也可能是破坏家庭的第三者，但这绝对不是我们使用它的原因。我们使用这个词是因为它是"主人"一词的女性形式。

I would love for us to reclaim this term, rather than default to the male standard. Many "mastermind" groups already exist, but I would much rather exalt women's unique role in the coming and current changes in our world.

我希望我们能够重新定义这个词，而不是默认使用男性标准。虽然已经有很多"智囊团"存在，但我更希望颂扬女性在当今和未来世界中的独特角色。

#### The Victory Hangover | 胜利后遗症

You might notice something strange happen after you enjoy a big win. Maybe you made a move that increased your visibility, or you've made a Difficult Ask and gotten a yes you didn't expect. Maybe it's just that someone saw you and did something really fucking nice.

你可能会注意到，在你大获全胜后，发生了一些奇怪的事情。也许你做了一个举动，增加了你的曝光度，或者你提出了一个困难的问题，得到了意想不到的肯定答复。也许只是有人看到了你，做了一些非常好的事情。

If you've truly pressed an edge and expanded past a place that you're accustomed to (and I assure you, as you read this book, you will!), you may feel euphoric in the hours after the win. But the next day, you might experience some very unpleasant feelings indeed. We call this "post-expansion contraction," or a Victory Hangover.

如果你真的突破了自己习惯的界限（我保证，在阅读这本书时，你会的！），你可能会在胜利后的几小时内感到欣喜若狂。但第二天，你可能会经历一些非常不愉快的感觉。我们称之为"扩张后的收缩"，或胜利后遗症。

Often, a Victory Hangover takes the form of a shame spiral. You might feel despair or a sense of unease. You might find yourself obsessing over a minor detail or a mistake. Your hangover may feel like rage or fear. You might feel overexposed, resulting in a desire to hide. Sometimes this contraction can make you feel floaty—like you're lost, untethered.

胜利后遗症通常表现为羞愧的螺旋。你可能会感到绝望或不安。你可能会发现自己对一个小细节或一个错误念念不忘。你的后遗症可能会让你感到愤怒或恐惧。你可能会觉得自己被过度关注，从而产生想要躲藏的欲望。有时这种收缩会让你感到飘忽不定——就像你迷失了方向，失去了束缚。

Why does this happen? Your mind may know the difference between something you want and something you don't want, but your energy body simply records a change. It might be a rise, or an equally precipitous fall, but your energy body doesn't differentiate—it registers what has happened as a sudden change in altitude.

为什么会发生这种情况？你的头脑可能知道你想要的东西和你不想要的东西之间的区别，但你的能量体只是记录变化。无论是上升还是骤降，你的能量体不会区分——它只是记录了发生的突然变化。

The truth is: You're not the same person the day after your gallery show opens to fantastic reviews. You're not the same person after you perform your first surgery, after you get a green light to make a movie or a baby, or after you've confronted an estranged parent. The different parts of you will need a moment to catch up.

事实是：画廊展览开幕并获得好评后的第二天，你就不再是同一个人了。在你完成第一次手术之后，在你获得拍电影或生孩子的许可之后，或者在你面对疏远的父母之后，你就不再是同一个人了。你身上的不同部分需要一段时间来适应。

You will expand again, and develop a new set point. In the meantime, there are really boring, simple remedies that can ease the drop. You know most of them already: pajamas, Netflix, a bath with Epsom salts, lots of sex. A massage if you're feeling flush, and a good cry if you're not. Movement and dancing—anything body-based—will help. Ruben likes to recommend that clients buy themselves flowers while they're still in the euphoric phase so they can look at them when they're not. I like to throw on my Victorian bathrobe and call myself the Mistress of Darkness while I elegantly "take to my bed."

你会再次扩张，并形成一个新的基准点。与此同时，有一些非常无聊、简单的补救措施可以缓解这种落差。你已经知道其中的大部分了：睡衣，Netflix，用泻盐洗澡、大量的性生活。如果你手头宽裕，可以去按摩，如果不宽裕，也可以痛痛快快地哭一场。运动和跳舞——任何基于身体的活动——都会有帮助。鲁本喜欢建议客户在欣喜若狂阶段时给自己买花，这样当她们不那么开心时还能看到它们。我喜欢穿上维多利亚式浴袍，称自己为"黑暗女主人"，同时优雅地"上床睡觉"。

Here's what won't work when you're in the throes of a Victory Hangover: analysis. In fact, even a Victory Log is a bad idea. Also a bad idea? Picking a fight, which may seem tempting.

在经历胜利后遗症时，以下这些是行不通的：分析。事实上，甚至记录胜利日志也是个坏主意。另一个坏主意呢？挑起争端，这似乎很诱人。

Sharing what's happening with you will also help—but choose the ears carefully. People don't generally want to hear about how terrible it can feel to get something amazing. This is a great experience to share with your Mistress group.

分享你的感受也会有帮助——但要选择好听众。人们通常不愿意听你说自己得到了很棒的东西却感到糟糕的经历。这是一个可以与女主人小组分享的好经验。

The most important thing is not to misinterpret the hangover. It is not a sign that you've screwed up, or that you don't deserve the accolades or the visibility. It doesn't signal that you're not safe—even if that part of you feels like it's doubling down during the contraction. It wasn't a terrible mistake to expose a vulnerable desire, or to go after something you wanted, and it's definitely not a warning that you should never ever again challenge the status quo.

最重要的是不要误解后遗症。这并不意味着你搞砸了，或者你不配得到这些称赞或关注。它并不表示你不安全——即使在收缩期间你感觉更加不安。暴露一个脆弱的愿望或追求你想要的东西并不是一个可怕的错误，它绝对不是警告你永远不应该再挑战现状。

Ignore the words and nurture your animal body. This contraction is natural, and it doesn't last long, usually one to three days. As unpleasant as it might feel, you should celebrate it when it comes, because it almost always means you've done something really, really cool.

不要理会这些话，照顾好你的身体。这种收缩是自然的，不会持续很久，通常一到三天。虽然感觉不舒服，但你依然应该庆祝它到来，因为这几乎总是意味着你做了一件非常非常酷的事情。

Celebrate your wins. Celebrate the little tiny germ of the win inside the disaster. Celebrate the disaster and then celebrate the fact that you're celebrating the disaster.

庆祝你的胜利。庆祝灾难中胜利的微小萌芽。庆祝灾难，然后庆祝你正在庆祝灾难的事实。

If desire is how we know what the power is for, then legitimacy and self-celebration are about creating the ability to fully receive it once we get it—to anticipate it, enjoy it, revel in it, and use it fully. Self-celebrating allows us to absorb all the nutrients in our wins, so we can go out and win again.

如果欲望告诉我们权力的用途，那么合法性和自我庆祝就是让在我们获得权力后充分接纳它——去期待它，享受它，沉浸其中，并充分利用它。自我庆祝让我们吸收胜利中的所有养分，这样我们才能再次出发，赢得更多。
