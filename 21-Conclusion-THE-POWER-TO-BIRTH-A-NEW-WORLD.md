# CONCLUSION: THE POWER TO BIRTH A NEW WORLD | 结语：创造新世界的力量

The last exercise we do before students graduate from the most advanced courses we offer is called "The Firing Squad."

我们为最高级课程的学生毕业前安排的最后一个练习叫做"行刑队"。

Public speaking is already most people's worst nightmare—and The Firing Squad is the worst-case scenario pushed to its most outrageous. One student delivers a presentation, and her fellow advanced students—who are now skilled in all forms of provocative attack—take her down.

公开演讲已经是大多数人的噩梦了——而"行刑队"就是把最坏的情况推到最极端的地步。一个学生做演讲，而她那些已经精通各种挑衅攻击技巧的高级同学会把她批得体无完肤。

They criticize her clothing, her credentials, her mannerisms, her weight. They raise time concerns—"How much longer are we going to have to sit here?"—and yell unrelated questions. They call out of turn: "This is fucking boring"; "Aren't you too old to be teaching us about technology?" They tell her she looks hot, and ask her out on dates.

她们会批评她的穿着、资历、举止、体重。她们会抱怨时间——"我们还要在这里坐多久？"——还会大喊一些无关的问题。她们会插话："这他妈太无聊了"；"你教我们技术是不是太老了？"她们还会说她很性感，约她出去。

Watching this soon-to-be graduate own the room is a sheer delight. Because she doesn't just handle it—she tames an audience who has gone fully feral without skipping a beat or missing a word, without turning her attention in or ever losing her dominant sense of presence.

看着这个即将毕业的学生掌控全场，真是让人赏心悦目。因为她不只是应付过去——她驯服了一群完全失控的观众，没有漏掉一个节拍或一句话，没有把注意力转向内心，也从未失去她主导性的存在感。

A woman who has read this book knows how to ask, outrageously and congruently. She can spot a wolf in sheep's clothing and a sheep in a wolf's. She's fireproofed against no, so that when she hears it, she says, "Fuck yes—time to play." She loves nothing better than swatting bullshit resistance out of the way, turning the most difficult negotiations and conversations into games, where she shifts roles as if she's starring in a movie, exhilarated by her own imagination and imbued with a sense of play.

读过这本书的女人知道如何提出要求，既大胆又一致。她能识破披着羊皮的狼和披着狼皮的羊。她对"不"字免疫，所以当她听到时，她会说："太好了——该玩游戏了。"她最喜欢的就是把那些废话般的阻力扫到一边，把最困难的谈判和对话变成游戏，在那里她转换角色，就像在演电影一样，被自己的想象力激励，充满游戏感。

But as valuable—and indeed lifesaving—as many of these tools are, they are just that: tools. And their most valuable purpose for you will be in using them to hunt the life force—in yourself, and in someone else.

但是，尽管这些工具中有很多都很有价值——甚至能救命——但它们终究只是工具。它们对你最有价值的用途就是用它们来寻找生命力——在你自己的内心，也在别人身上。

The direction of our attention—the conversation under the conversation—is a direction of the life force. Attention makes things grow, and you are now a vitality barometer. Not only can you hear no, but you hear the invitation to intimacy the other person is confessing with it. You will use what's alive in yourself to tap into what's alive in another person. This leads to a new kind of conversation—one that is fully embodied, deeply meaningful, and powerfully influential.

我们注意力的方向——对话之下的对话——就是生命力的方向。注意力让事物成长，你现在就是一个活力晴雨表。你不仅能听到"不"，还能听到对方用"不"字所坦白的亲密邀请。你会用自己内心的活力去触碰别人内心的活力。这会带来一种新的对话——一种完全体现的、意义深远的、影响力强大的对话。

### Conversation is what made the rules, and it's what will change them.

### 对话创造了规则，对话也会改变规则。

The new desires, ideas, and directions that come out of these new kinds of conversations are wonderfully unpredictable. They question and test the reality that we've created. These conversations lead to new visions, new actions—and new conversations, ensuring that the cycle toward life and light continues. And they are transformative, because these conversations unearth the truth of what we all deeply want and need.

从这些新型对话中产生的新渴望、新想法和新方向都美妙得不可预测。它们质疑和测试我们创造的现实。这些对话带来新的愿景、新的行动——以及新的对话，确保朝向生命和光明的循环继续下去。它们是变革性的，因为这些对话挖掘出我们所有人内心深处真正想要和需要的东西。

This isn't "positive thinking," but phototropism—how we change in order to grow toward the light. We have been told that we're fundamentally sinful and wrong—animalistic monsters that need to be monitored and self-policed. But our natural tendencies are to move toward what's alive, and what nourishes life.

这不是"积极思考"，而是向光性——我们如何为了朝向光明而改变。我们被告知我们本质上是罪恶和错误的——是需要被监视和自我约束的动物性怪物。但我们的自然倾向是朝向有生命力的东西，朝向滋养生命的东西。

If that is how you are moving through the world, then, like one of my students, you might find yourself negotiating with a dictator to save enormous swaths of the rainforest. Or having your first orgasm—and then meeting with Muslim clerics to teach them how the Koran supports women's sexuality.

如果你以这种方式在世界中前行，那么，就像我的一个学生一样，你可能会发现自己与独裁者谈判来拯救大片雨林。或者经历你的第一次高潮——然后与穆斯林神职人员会面，教他们《古兰经》如何支持女性的性权利。

You don't have to examine the past to heal it; with these tools, we create a present that proves to you that the future can be anything you want it to be.

你不必审视过去来治愈它；有了这些工具，我们创造一个现在，向你证明未来可以是你想要的任何样子。

This book tells the story of Good Girl conditioning, and how we break out of the compression it imposes on us on our journey toward a new kind of power.

这本书讲述了"好女孩"模式的故事，以及我们如何在通往新型力量的旅程中摆脱它强加给我们的压抑。

Men have their story, too. For millennia, they've been told to stuff down their feelings, to man up, to go to war and die for us. Their conditioning doesn't really work for them, either. The immensity of the emotional violence they experience in order to become men and the punishments that follow for many of them when they start feeling their empathy are tragic.

男人也有他们的故事。几千年来，他们被告知要压抑自己的情感，要像个男人，要为我们去打仗、去死。他们的模式对他们来说也并不真正有效。他们为了成为男人而经历的巨大的情感暴力，以及当他们开始感受同理心时许多人遭受的惩罚，都是悲剧性的。

I don't teach men. But it is my hope that teaching women the art of powerful conversation and attention will also help men to recover what they've lost. A woman who has mastered these skills can do a lot to shepherd a man toward what's missing.

我不教男人。但我希望，教女人掌握有力对话和注意力的艺术，也能帮助男人恢复他们失去的东西。一个掌握了这些技能的女人可以做很多事情来引导男人找到缺失的东西。

Stories end. Romantic stories often end with a wedding—but any married person will tell you that's the beginning, not the end. Adventures end when the villain is defeated, but that's just the setup for a sequel.

故事会结束。浪漫故事往往以婚礼结束——但任何已婚的人都会告诉你那是开始，不是结束。冒险在反派被打败时结束，但那只是续集的铺垫。

Where we are, as women today, is not the end of the story, not by a long shot. So while this book is coming to a close, the story—your story—is just beginning. This is where a new kind of life, lived intentionally and collectively, begins.

作为今天的女性，我们所在的地方并不是故事的结尾，远不是。所以虽然这本书即将结束，但故事——你的故事——才刚刚开始。这就是一种新的生活开始的地方，一种有意识地、集体地生活的新生活。

What happens next will be wildly unexpected—and absolutely perfect.

接下来发生的事情将完全出乎意料——也绝对完美。
