# Chapter 15: WHISPER OR SHOUT? | 第十五章：低语还是呐喊？

## The Power to Calibrate | 校准的力量

There are twelve hundred women in this lecture hall. I feel how amped up they are—the take-no-prisoners feeling in the room is unmistakable. They're on fire, and what they want to know is: "How do I crush, destroy—eviscerate—the assholes in my life?"

这个演讲厅里有一千两百名女性。我能感觉到她们有多么兴奋——房间里毫不留情的氛围是显而易见的。她们很兴奋，她们想知道的是："我如何粉碎、摧毁——撕裂——我生活中的混蛋？"

I scan the audience for a raised hand, and task them with the Turning the Spotlight exercise you're so familiar with by now. "Don't answer the question I'm about to ask you. Instead: put your attention out—on me—and ask me back a question." Then I lob an uncomfortable question: "Do you like giving blow jobs?" Or: "Do you think being black helped you get into Harvard?" Or simply: "Are you single?"

我扫描观众寻找举手的人，并给她们布置转向聚光灯的练习，你现在已经非常熟悉了。"不要回答我要问你的问题。相反：把你的注意力向外——放在我身上——然后问我一个问题。"然后我抛出一个不舒服的问题："你喜欢口交吗？"或者："你认为身为黑人帮助了你进入哈佛吗？"或者简单地说："你是单身吗？"

You know what happens next: that first woman answers, and so does the second. The third asks me: "Have you been picturing me giving blow jobs?" She thinks it's a slam, but where's the attention, if I'm thinking about her giving a blow job?

你知道接下来会发生什么：第一个女人回答了，第二个也是。第三个问我："你一直在想象我口交吗？"她认为这是重击，但如果我在想她口交，注意力在哪里？

The next one asks me where I got my belt. That's great—it gives her a moment to breathe, but it's too easy for me to call out her deflection: "How come you didn't answer my question?"

下一个问我从哪里得到我的腰带。这很好——它给了她一个呼吸的时刻，但对我来说太容易指出她的回避："你为什么没有回答我的问题？"

The one after that comes out swinging: "Who the fuck do you think you are, to ask me that?" she screams. Her delivery is so harsh that the whole room roars. This is phenomenal self-defense; at this stage, I'd much rather see her deliver a body slam than get stuck in the Freeze. And she has moved the room into a real, if raw, understanding of the dominant state of attention.

下一个大声喊道："你他妈以为你是谁，问我那个？"她尖叫。她的表达是如此严厉，整个房间都咆哮起来。这是惊人的自卫；在这个阶段，我宁愿看到她进行身体打击，而不是被困在冻结中。她已经把房间带入了一个真实的，即使粗糙的，对主导注意力状态的理解。

But a wild counterattack like that won't always be appropriate. In real life, it's likely to shut the game all the way down—which is fine, if that's what's needed. Still, we want her to have a choice: the same skills she uses to defend and attack can also be used to transform many of the assholes she encounters into enthusiastic allies. A heroic soldier dedicated to your cause tends to be much more valuable than a castrated corpse.

但像那样的疯狂反击并不总是合适的。在现实生活中，它可能会完全关闭游戏——如果这是需要的，那很好。尽管如此，我们希望她有一个选择：她用来防御和攻击的相同技能也可以用来将她遇到的许多混蛋转变为热情的盟友。一个致力于你事业的英勇士兵往往比被阉割的尸体更有价值。

And so, in this chapter, we'll explore calibration, or how hard to hit back.

因此，在这一章中，我们将探索校准，或者反击的力度。

In class, a woman's first attempts at calibration can be pretty messy. Sometimes, she thinks she's been very firm, when she actually sounded accommodating and willing to compromise. More often, though, she thinks she's tossed off a witty little quip when in reality she's practically blasted the guy's face off with the rage she's accumulated over a lifetime of being female on this planet.

在课堂上，女性第一次尝试校准可能会很混乱。有时，她认为她非常坚定，但实际上她听起来很随和，愿意妥协。但更常见的是，她认为她抛出了一个机智的小玩笑，但实际上她几乎用她作为女性在这个星球上一生积累的愤怒把那个家伙的脸炸掉了。

Without alchemizing the emotions behind the question, the communication is likely to come across as incongruent—too harsh, like my friend above, or manipulative instead of a gentle touch. This is why I suggest that before you embark on a Difficult Ask—or any Ask, actually—you do a Things Unsaid.

不炼金问题背后的情绪，沟通可能会显得不一致——太严厉，像我上面的朋友，或者操纵性而不是轻柔的触摸。这就是为什么我建议在你进行困难要求——或任何要求，实际上——之前，你做一次"未曾言说之事"（Things Unsaid）。

We do find that the more skilled practitioners in the school—women who have spent a lot of time doing exercises like Things Unsaid (this page) and Bad Girl Protocol (this page)—tend to calibrate unconsciously.

我们确实发现，学校里更熟练的实践者——那些花了很多时间做像"未曾言说之事"（本页）和"坏女孩准则"（本页）这样的练习的女性——倾向于无意识地校准。

### The Power of Curiosity | 好奇心的力量

The most important tool for calibration is to get your attention out—really out.

校准最重要的工具是让你的注意力向外——真正向外。

When a student's attention is really out on me, they pick up on my nonverbal cues. They can tell, just by watching my body and listening to the tone of my voice, whether I'm playacting an innocent dope or a lecherous predator. And so a question like "Why don't you have children?" might be met with a sharp rebuke, like "Do you realize how incredibly uncomfortable a question like that might make a woman feel?" while "Do you like threesomes?" might be met with a flirtatious "My, aren't you bold! Why do you ask? Are you taking a poll?"

当学生的注意力真正在我身上时，他们会捕捉到我的非语言线索。他们可以通过观察我的身体和听我声音的语调来判断我是在扮演一个无辜的傻瓜还是一个好色的捕食者。因此，像"你为什么没有孩子？"这样的问题可能会遇到严厉的斥责，比如"你意识到像这样的问题可能会让一个女人感到多么不舒服吗？"而"你喜欢三人行吗？"可能会遇到调情的"我的天，你不是很勇敢吗！你为什么问？你在做民意调查吗？"

Attention out is how you will know whether you're hitting too hard or so softly that you're not even reaching the other person. There's a whole spectrum between a whisper and a shout! How will you know where to land? The right amount of pressure will shift the other person into a receptive space.

注意力向外是你如何知道你打击得太重还是太轻，以至于你甚至没有接触到另一个人。在低语和呐喊之间有一整个光谱！你怎么知道在哪里着陆？合适的压力会让另一个人进入一个接受的空间。

There's a video I like to show of a golden retriever taking control of her pups. When the mother dog comes into the enclosure, the scene is chaos: the puppies are hysterical, falling all over themselves, nipping at her and each other. She gets her body clear of them, turns around, and barks—loud and hard.

有一个视频我喜欢展示，是一只金毛猎犬控制她的小狗。当母狗进入围栏时，场面一片混乱：小狗们歇斯底里，到处乱跑，咬她和彼此。她让她的身体离开它们，转过身，大声而有力地吠叫。

Right away, most of the pups settle down. She is fierce with them, but if you watch with the sound off, you see that her body is relaxed and calm, and the puppies aren't frightened, even the one she snaps at most aggressively. Instead, you can see the puppies move from attention out—gimme, gimme, gimme!—to attention in. They lie down to rest and groom themselves, reassured by her show of strength: "Oh, thank God. Mom's home!"

立刻，大多数小狗都安静下来了。她对它们很凶猛，但如果你把声音关掉看，你会看到她的身体是放松和冷静的，小狗们并不害怕，甚至是被她最激烈地咬的那个。相反，你可以看到小狗们从注意力向外——给我，给我，给我！——转向注意力向内。它们躺下来休息和梳理自己，被她的力量展示所安抚："哦，感谢上帝。妈妈回家了！"

The video shows a spectacular display of dominance—it's wild to watch how skillfully this experienced mother moves her puppies into a submissive state, their attention turned back onto themselves. But what's most interesting to me is how meticulously the mother dog calibrates her reprimands. Her first bark is big and quite scary—but there are a lot of puppies, and they're really out of control. After the majority of them have settled down, she barks again, really sharply, at a couple of the fractious ones, the stubborn cases who haven't quite gotten the message. After that, she has only to look hard at the one last straggler before he falls in line, too.

这个视频展示了一个壮观的支配展示——观看这位经验丰富的母亲如何巧妙地将她的小狗们移入顺从状态，它们的注意力转回自己身上，这是狂野的。但对我来说最有趣的是母狗如何细致地校准她的斥责。她的第一次吠叫很大，相当可怕——但有很多小狗，它们真的失控了。在大多数都安静下来之后，她再次吠叫，非常尖锐地，对着几个好斗的，那些还没有完全得到信息的顽固案例。在那之后，她只需要严厉地看着最后一个掉队者，然后他也站好了队。

The intensity of her dominance is precisely what is required—exactly and only—to move and keep the puppies into a submissive state.

她支配的强度正是所需要的——精确地，只有——来移动和保持小狗们进入顺从状态。

### One Question, Three Scenarios | 一个问题，三个场景

To explore calibration, we're going to use a request that very well might cause you to freeze—"Tell me your sexual fantasies." But there are a thousand different ways that question can be asked, and we're going to look at how you might calibrate your response in three very different scenarios. What happens next—and what you want to happen next—will depend largely on the context of the question.

为了探索校准，我们将使用一个很可能会让你冻结的请求——"告诉我你的性幻想。"但这个问题可以有一千种不同的问法，我们将看看你如何在三个非常不同的场景中校准你的回应。接下来会发生什么——以及你想让接下来发生什么——将主要取决于问题的上下文。

While a question about the question may be the blunt-force fix to get yourself off the spot, context is what determines how hard you should hit back.

虽然关于问题的问题可能是让你摆脱困境的钝力修复，但上下文决定了你应该反击多用力。

Context determines calibration.

上下文决定校准。

In all of these scenarios, you will put your attention out on the other person; you will occupy the dominant state of attention. In all of these scenarios, you will ask the other person a question about the question, and sense and test your way to more information.

在所有这些场景中，你将把注意力向外放在另一个人身上；你将占据主导的注意力状态。在所有这些场景中，你将问另一个人一个关于问题的问题，并感受和测试你的方式来获得更多信息。

The only difference is in how hard or soft you choose to play.

唯一的区别是你选择玩得多硬或多软。

Scenario 1: You and your boss are ending a long conference day by shutting down the hotel bar with a whiskey, or six.

场景1：你和你的老板正在用一杯或六杯威士忌结束漫长会议日，关闭酒店酒吧。

Scenario 2: Your second date with a very intriguing and attractive person is going very (very) well, but you're not quite sure you're ready to answer such an intimate question from them yet.

场景2：你与一个非常有趣和有吸引力的人的第二次约会进行得非常好（非常），但你不太确定你准备好回答他们如此亲密的问题。

Scenario 3: Your loving and generous partner genuinely wants to know how the two of you can deepen and expand the incredible sexual chemistry between the two of you. You're thrilled that they asked—the question felt like a lightning bolt to your pussy, in the very best way—but you've never been very good at talking about sex stuff.

场景3：你充满爱心和慷慨的伴侣真正想知道你们两个人如何深化和扩展你们之间令人难以置信的性化学反应。你对他们问了感到兴奋——这个问题感觉像是闪电击中你的阴部，以最好的方式——但你从未擅长谈论性相关的事情。

So here we have one question and three very different scenarios—all of which might, for different reasons, cause you to Freeze. Your primary strategy, Turning the Spotlight with a question about the question, will not change. But the questions you ask, and how you ask them, will.

所以我们有一个问题和三个非常不同的场景——所有这些都可能因为不同的原因导致你冻结。你的主要策略，用一个关于问题的问题转向聚光灯，不会改变。但你问的问题，以及你如何问它们，会改变。

In Scenario 1, you're likely going to want to shut this down using a fairly hard touch. Some questions you could turn on your drunken boss: "Do you realize that you're being incredibly inappropriate at this moment?" "Are you aware of the damage a question like that could do to our working relationship?" "Do you realize what kind of position you put a woman in with a question like that?" (Note the use of dominant and third-party language here.)

在场景1中，你可能会想用一个相当强硬的触摸来关闭这个。你可以对你喝醉的老板问的一些问题："你意识到你此刻非常不合适吗？" "你意识到像这样的问题可能对我们的工作关系造成的损害吗？" "你意识到像这样的问题把女人放在什么样的位置吗？"（注意这里使用主导和第三方语言。）

A softer touch would be something like: "Don't you think it's time for you to stop talking and go to sleep?" This amounts to a hall pass, which is yours to issue, should you choose. Men are humans, and every one of us can make a shitty mistake, like hitting on a subordinate when you've had too much to drink. I also believe it is possible to correct men for behavior like this, and for women to accept their apology and move on.

更轻柔的触摸会是像："你不认为是你停止说话去睡觉的时候了吗？"这相当于一张通行证，如果你选择的话，它是你颁发的。男人是人类，我们每个人都会犯糟糕的错误，比如在你喝得太多的时候勾引下属。我也相信纠正男人的这种行为是可能的，女性接受他们的道歉并继续前进也是可能的。

Of course, I've also heard hundreds of stories from friends and female students—of men who apologized, only to pursue the nineteen-year-old intern instead; of subtle, untraceable punishments for sexual rejection that ruined careers; about HR departments more concerned about snuffing out potential lawsuits than guaranteeing the safety and welfare of female employees.

当然，我也从朋友和女学生那里听到了数百个故事——男人道歉了，却转而追求十九岁的实习生；因为性拒绝而毁掉职业生涯的微妙、无法追踪的惩罚；关于人力资源部门更关心扼杀潜在诉讼而不是保证女性雇员的安全和福利。

There's very little way to tell how a scenario like this will ultimately play out, which is another reason why it's so unfortunate. But being able to break the Freeze will allow you to gather your wits about you long enough to make an assessment about what comes next—whether that's a trip to HR or a big glass of water and a good night's sleep.

几乎没有办法知道像这样的场景最终会如何发展，这就是为什么如此不幸的另一个原因。但能够打破冻结将让你有足够的时间集中精神，评估接下来会发生什么——无论是去人力资源部门还是喝一大杯水好好睡一觉。

In Scenario 2, our sexy second date who's gotten a little ahead of themselves, you will want to get off the spot without answering a question you don't want to answer, but also without shutting the game all the way down. So you could play with flirtatious, delaying questions like "Aren't you forward, to be asking about sexual fantasies on a second date?"

在场景2中，我们性感的第二次约会对象有点超前，你会想摆脱困境而不回答你不想回答的问题，但也不要完全关闭游戏。所以你可以用调情的、延迟的问题来玩，比如"你不是很前卫吗，在第二次约会时就问性幻想？"

Your next "question" doesn't always have to be a question, if the first one got you off the spot. "You're going to have to wait a little longer and work a little harder before you get an answer to a question like that." Note the use of dominant language: a "you" statement, and an instruction.

如果你的第一个问题让你摆脱了困境，你的下一个"问题"不一定总是一个问题。"在得到像这样的问题的答案之前，你将不得不等待更长时间并更努力地工作。"注意使用主导语言：一个"你"的陈述，和一个指令。

And with our loving partner in Scenario 3, you'll want to use a very light touch indeed. You get yourself off the spot with a question about the question like "How long have you been thinking about asking that?" "What inspired you to ask that tonight?" "If you find out, how will it make you feel?"

在我们场景3中充满爱心的伴侣，你会想使用非常轻的触摸。你用关于问题的问题来让自己摆脱困境，比如"你一直在想问那个多长时间了？" "是什么启发你今晚问那个？" "如果你发现了，那会让你感觉如何？"

And you can push this even further, into a scene that might be very fun for the two of you to explore: "How would it feel to know that you have a shy, secretive wife, full of sexual fantasies you're going to have to gently tease out of her?"

你可以更进一步，进入一个对你们两个人来说可能非常有趣的场景："知道你有一个害羞、秘密的妻子，充满你必须温柔地取出的性幻想，那会是什么感觉？"

What I'd most like you to appreciate is how much space you can create for dialogue and influence—if you so choose—once you're off the spot. Consider the following:

我最希望你能欣赏的是，一旦你摆脱困境，你可以为对话和影响力创造多少空间——如果你选择这样做。考虑以下情况：

One of my students, a successful small business owner, is often asked, "You look like such a baby—how old are you?"

我的一个学生，一个成功的小企业主，经常被问到，"你看起来像个婴儿——你多大了？"

For years, the question caused her to Freeze: she'd splutter and become defensive, letting her irritation show. Now she Turns the Spotlight—and finds that it's an extremely valuable opening for a new client to talk about his priorities and concerns.

多年来，这个问题让她冻结：她会结结巴巴，变得防御性，让她的恼怒表现出来。现在她转向聚光灯——发现这是一个非常有价值的开口，让新客户谈论他的优先事项和关切。

"Why does it matter to you how old I am?"

"为什么我多大对你重要？"

"It's just that you look so young."

"只是你看起来如此年轻。"

"What's your real question? Are you really asking how long I've been doing this? Are you worried that hiring me is going to be a waste of your money?"

"你真正的问题是什么？你真的是在问我做这个多久了吗？你担心雇用我会浪费你的钱吗？"

"No, of course not. It's just that I'm going to have to go back to my board and explain to them why we should go with a small boutique agency instead of one of the big guys. So, yeah, I guess I am a little worried about your experience and the depth of your bench."

"不，当然不是。只是我将不得不回到我的董事会，向他们解释为什么我们应该选择一个小型精品机构而不是大公司之一。所以，是的，我想我确实有点担心你的经验和你的团队的深度。"

That's a valid concern, which she can now address if she keeps her attention out.

这是一个合理的关切，如果她保持注意力向外，她现在可以解决。

"I can prepare a packet of materials that you can bring to your board, which should more than satisfy their concerns."

"我可以准备一套材料，你可以带给你的董事会，这应该超过满足他们的关切。"

He nods, but her attention is still out, and she can tell by what she sees in his body that he's not completely convinced. She wants to land this account, and tries another strategy to move him.

他点头，但她的注意力仍然向外，她可以通过她在他身体中看到的来判断他并没有完全信服。她想拿下这个客户，并尝试另一种策略来打动他。

"How about I fly back to New York with you, to present the materials myself?"

"我和你一起飞回纽约，亲自展示材料怎么样？"

She sees his eyes light up and his body relax. Bingo.

她看到他的眼睛亮起来，身体放松。宾果。

### The Power to Play | 游戏的力量

When we do Uncomfortable Questions in class, I notice that my students begin to calibrate all by themselves after a couple rounds.

当我们在课堂上做不舒服的问题时，我注意到我的学生在几轮后开始自己校准。

It's not so much that they've gotten into the swing of Turning the Spotlight—it's because they're having fun.

这并不是说他们已经掌握了转向聚光灯的节奏——而是因为他们玩得很开心。

They're calibrating naturally because they're starting to play, something they can afford to do only because they're no longer afraid of shutting down. And it's how I know that they're starting to feel what I'm teaching, as opposed to simply hearing it. That playfulness is a sign that they're truly embodying their power.

他们自然地校准，因为他们开始游戏，这是他们能够承受的事情，只是因为他们不再害怕关闭。这就是我知道他们开始感受我教的东西，而不仅仅是听到它的方式。那种游戏性是他们在真正体现自己力量的标志。

I'm known in class for trying a million different things when I'm working with a woman: Ask like you're Scarlett O'Hara! Grab your tits! Put on this Sherlock Holmes hat!

我在课堂上以在与女性一起工作时尝试一百万种不同的事情而闻名：像斯嘉丽·奥哈拉一样问！抓住你的胸！戴上这顶夏洛克·福尔摩斯帽子！

As much as I'd like to tell you this is a brilliant, preplanned, multifaceted technique designed to open a student to her inner truth, all I'm really doing is sensing and testing, which could also be called "playing around." I'm trying something, seeing how it lands, and recalibrating. Did she giggle? Did a really uncomfortable look pass over her face when she put her hand on her heart? What worked? What worked better? What hits the spot?

尽管我很想告诉你这是一个聪明的、预先计划的、多方面的技术，旨在让学生向她的内在真理开放，但我真正做的只是感知和测试，这也可以被称为"四处玩耍"。我在尝试一些东西，看它如何着陆，然后重新校准。她咯咯笑了吗？当她把手放在心脏上时，一个真正不舒服的表情是否掠过她的脸？什么有效？什么更有效？什么击中要害？

Every child knows: There are no mistakes when you're playing. And if you stay curious, you're always learning something, even if it's not what you're looking for. I might try fifty things before I get the burst of energy that tells me I've landed on something important, but a sense of playfulness and genuine curiosity turns what a Good Girl might call a series of errors into a dance of discovery that continues until we land in the spot that's most alive, the one that will move the game forward.

每个孩子都知道：当你玩游戏时，没有错误。如果你保持好奇，你总是在学习一些东西，即使它不是你在寻找的。我可能会尝试五十件事，然后才能得到那告诉我我已经找到重要东西的能量爆发，但游戏感和真正的好奇心将好女孩可能称之为一系列错误的东西变成了发现的舞蹈，持续到我们着陆在最活跃的地方，那个会推动游戏前进的地方。

Curiosity is essential for effective calibration—especially if you want to keep the conversation going once you're off the spot. Asking a question you genuinely want to know the answer to, even if that question is "Seriously, what the fuck made you think you could ask me that?" is much more likely to effectively shift the dynamic than a random one, or one that's scripted to score a point.

好奇心对于有效的校准至关重要——特别是如果你想在摆脱困境后继续对话。问一个你真正想知道答案的问题，即使那个问题是"说真的，是什么他妈的让你认为你可以问我那个？"比随机的问题或为得分而写的问题更有可能有效地改变动态。

So if your first question is designed simply to get you off the spot, then try for your second question to be informed by curiosity—to come out of what happens when you really notice the other person and are driven to know more.

所以如果你的第一个问题只是为了让你摆脱困境而设计的，那么试着让你的第二个问题由好奇心告知——来自于当你真正注意到另一个人并被驱使想知道更多时发生的事情。

And if context is difficult to determine—as it might be with someone you don't know well—use your location tools: "It seems like you're flirting with me, but you're also being really insulting. Did you read one of those idiotic pickup artist manuals? Is that what happened?"

如果上下文难以确定——就像你对不太熟悉的人那样——使用你的定位工具："似乎你在和我调情，但你也在真的侮辱我。你读过那些白痴的把妹艺术家手册之一吗？这就是发生的事情吗？"

Playfulness and curiosity can take you to incredibly provocative and intimate places. There's nothing soft about these power tools, even though they're gentle to hold and fun to explore.

游戏性和好奇心可以带你到令人难以置信的挑衅和亲密的地方。这些权力工具没有什么是柔软的，尽管它们握起来很温柔，探索起来很有趣。

When I see a woman who can ride into a difficult situation while maintaining both her power and her sense of play, relying on her imagination and her curiosity about the life and movement in a dynamic, then I know she's graduated from what I can teach her, and I tell her to go out and spread the word.

当我看到一个能够在进入困难情况时既保持她的力量又保持她的游戏感，依赖她的想象力和她对动态中生命和运动的好奇心的女性时，我知道她已经从我教给她的东西中毕业了，我告诉她出去传播这个词。

### "What if I Go Too Far?" | "如果我走得太远怎么办？"

In almost every class, someone raises their hand with a concern: "What if I go too far?"

几乎在每一堂课中，都有人举手关切地问："如果我走得太远怎么办？"

First of all: On a cosmic scale, the harm caused by women not speaking is so colossal, so massive, and so out of proportion to the harm that might be caused by a woman stepping out and asking for something, it almost doesn't matter if you go too far. If the next two thousand years were spent with women riding slipshod over men and their desires and their rights as human beings, we still wouldn't be caught up; a woman inelegantly asking for a raise or more administrative support or different sex doesn't even begin to tip the scale.

首先：在宇宙尺度上，女性不说话的伤害是如此巨大、如此庞大，与女性站出来要求某事可能造成的伤害如此不成比例，如果你走得太远，这几乎无关紧要。如果接下来的两千年女性对男人、他们的欲望和他们作为人类的权利马虎地骑在上面，我们仍然不会赶上来；一个女性不优雅地要求加薪或更多行政支持或不同的性甚至不会开始倾斜天平。

I'm much less concerned with calibration than I am with getting you off the spot—with giving you the tools to break the Freeze. Better that you should come off as too harsh or a little mealymouthed than betray yourself by having sex you don't want or agreeing to more work for less money than you're worth. In an ideal world, you'd be so graceful and skilled that he wouldn't even notice you'd routed him until he was blocks away. But if someone is going to leave the interaction wounded, I'd much sooner it be him than you.

我对校准的关注远不如让你摆脱困境——给你打破冻结的工具。你最好是过于严厉或有点甜言蜜语，而不是通过做你不想做的性行为或同意以低于你价值的价格做更多工作来背叛自己。在理想世界中，你会如此优雅和熟练，他甚至不会注意到你在他几街区之外就已经引导了他。但如果有人要带着伤口离开互动，我宁愿是他而不是你。

More practically? The breakage just doesn't happen. Women leave my classes charged up and asking for all kinds of crazy-ass shit in sometimes unlovely ways, and they tell us how it went.

更实际地说？破裂根本没有发生。女性离开我的课程时充满活力，有时以不讨人喜欢的方式要求各种疯狂的狗屎，她们告诉我们情况如何。

What they report is that once they got their attention all the way out and could keep it there, they could say and do a lot that would have been hurtful, offensive, or inappropriate if their attention had been turned inward, or jammed up in the Smush. Attention out meant they were energetically holding their sub, which made the correction easier to take, and because they'd done the emotional alchemy work in Things Unsaid and Bad Girl Protocol, their calibration was appropriate.

他们报告的是，一旦他们把注意力完全向外，并且能够保持在那里，他们可以说和做很多如果他们的注意力向内转或在压抑中卡住就会是有害的、冒犯的或不恰当的事情。注意力向外意味着他们在精力上持有他们的顺从者，这使得纠正更容易接受，并且因为他们已经在"未曾言说之事"和"坏女孩准则"中做了情感炼金术工作，他们的校准是合适的。

If Asking and negotiating conflict in the ways that we teach destroyed relationships, we'd know about it. Sometimes women do come back to us for help with the next step, but in the years we've been doing this, I cannot think of a single request that has resulted in damage. Indeed, every day, the very opposite is true: women report the truly enormous, jaw-dropping, desire-quenching requests they've made, and share their life-altering, surprising, game-changing results.

如果以我们教的方式要求和谈判冲突摧毁了关系，我们会知道的。有时女性确实回来寻求下一步的帮助，但在我们做这件事的这些年里，我想不出一个导致损害的要求。事实上，每天，相反的情况是真的：女性报告她们做出的真正巨大的、令人瞠目结舌的、欲望满足的要求，并分享她们改变生活的、令人惊讶的、改变游戏规则的结果。

That said, of course it's not impossible to go too far, especially at the beginning. Maybe you'll make a mess. Maybe you'll be cruel; maybe you'll do something morally reprehensible. You very well may hurt someone's feelings. But that is not the same thing as actually hurting them, or causing irreparable damage.

话虽如此，当然走得太远不是不可能的，特别是在开始时。也许你会搞得一团糟。也许你会很残忍；也许你会做一些道德上应受谴责的事情。你很可能伤害某人的感情。但这与真正伤害他们或造成无法弥补的损害不同。

In fact, one of my students has a tattoo that reads "99%"—a reminder to herself that 99 percent of the time, she can get herself out of the trouble she got herself into. The tattoo prompts her to embrace friction, and serves as a physical reminder of how much fun it is when she goes far enough out to get into trouble.

事实上，我的一个学生有一个纹身，上面写着"99%"——提醒自己99%的时候，她可以让自己摆脱她给自己惹的麻烦。纹身促使她拥抱摩擦，并作为一个身体提醒，当她走得太远陷入麻烦时是多么有趣。

I trust you. I trust you to keep your attention out so that you'll know if you've crossed a line. I trust you to see the effects of your actions, and to clean up what you've done if you need to. But when you're truly speaking your desire, speaking up on behalf of what you're fighting for, it's hard to go too far.

我信任你。我信任你保持注意力向外，这样你就会知道你是否越过了界线。我信任你看到你行为的效果，如果需要的话，清理你所做的事情。但当你真正说出你的欲望，代表你为之奋斗的东西发言时，很难走得太远。

In general, we find that women trend conservative. Even when they think they've gone too far, they haven't gone far enough. So, in a world where the presiding ethos is to move fast and break things, I'd urge you to go further than feels comfortable. Be direct. Be outrageous. Be skilled. Be playful. We've got a lot of ground to make up.

总的来说，我们发现女性倾向于保守。即使当她们认为她们走得太远时，她们也没有走得足够远。所以，在一个主导精神是快速行动和打破东西的世界里，我敦促你走得比感觉舒适更远。要直接。要出格。要熟练。要游戏性。我们有很多基础要弥补。
