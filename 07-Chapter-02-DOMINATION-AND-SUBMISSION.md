# Chapter 02: DOMINATION AND SUBMISSION | 第二章：支配与顺从

## The Art of Attention | 注意力的艺术

Equality is a beautiful concept.

平等是一个美丽的概念。

But the truth is that, in every moment of every interaction, every conversation, every collaboration, someone is leading and someone else is following. In a great conversation, two people switch back and forth, and the transition between leading and following happens so effortlessly and seamlessly that it's practically invisible, like a dance. This subtlety doesn't mean it's not happening, though—one of them is always directing, the other receiving.

但事实是，在每一次互动、每一次对话、每一次合作的每一刻，都有人在领导，有人在跟随。在一次精彩的对话中，两个人来回切换，领导和跟随之间的转换是如此轻松和无缝，几乎不可见，就像舞蹈一样。但这种微妙并不意味着它没有发生——他们中的一个总是在引导，另一个在接收。

This is the first way that women find themselves at a disadvantage as it pertains to power. Most women have been trained to be profoundly uncomfortable with hierarchy. Many of us prefer to deny that power dynamics exist, outside of games played by greedy, dishonest manipulators. But, like gravity, just because you deny the existence of something doesn't mean it doesn't affect you. Power dynamics are how humans and animals organize themselves, and women are participating whether they like it or not. Our denial simply means that we're participating at a disadvantage.

这是女性在权力方面处于劣势的第一种方式。大多数女性被训练得对等级制度感到非常不舒服。我们中的许多人宁愿否认权力动态的存在，除非是贪婪、不诚实的操纵者玩的游戏。但是，就像重力一样，仅仅因为你否认某物的存在并不意味着它不会影响你。权力动态是人类和动物组织自己的方式，无论她们喜不喜欢，女性都在参与。我们的否认仅仅意味着我们在以劣势参与。

No more.

不再如此。

In this book, I will use the term "dominance" to describe the state when your attention is focused out and what you do from that place, and the term "submission" to describe the state of attention turned inward, and what you feel from that place.

在这本书中，我将使用"支配"一词来描述你的注意力向外集中的状态以及你从那个位置所做的事情，使用"顺从"一词来描述注意力向内转的状态以及你从那个位置所感受到的。

Both terms are loaded, but let me reassure you up front: neither is what you think. My definition of dominance has nothing to do with the violent, toxic mimic of power we see every day; it's not screaming, or bullying, or "acting like a man," whatever that means. Neither is there anything obsequious or subservient about submission in this system.

这两个术语都带有情感色彩，但让我先向你保证：它们都不是你想象的那样。我对支配的定义与我们每天看到的暴力、有毒的权力模仿无关；它不是尖叫、欺凌或"表现得像男人"，无论那意味着什么。在这个系统中，顺从也绝不是卑躬屈膝或奴颜婢膝。

In fact, all the negative connotations that come with our first associations with those words relate to when both are done badly—specifically, when someone is exhibiting dominant or submissive behavior (screaming orders, for instance, or asking for something in a cutesy little-girl voice) without properly attending to the direction of their attention.

事实上，我们对这些词的初次联想所带来的所有负面含义都与两者做得很糟糕的时候有关——具体来说，就是当某人表现出支配或顺从行为（比如尖叫命令，或用可爱的小女孩声音要求某物）而没有正确关注他们注意力的方向时。

### The World of You: The Surrendered, Submissive State | 你的世界：投降的顺从状态

"Oh, honey! Submission's not an option," Cheryl tells me flatly. "I'm a small business owner and the mother of three kids under twelve. If I'm not in complete control every second, this ship will go down."

"哦，亲爱的！顺从不是选择，"谢丽尔直截了当地告诉我。"我是一家小企业的老板，还是三个十二岁以下孩子的母亲。如果我不每时每刻完全控制，这艘船就会沉没。"

Ah, submissives. The passive, pathetic, mewling weaklings in the corner, barely worthy of a second glance.

啊，被支配者。角落里被动的、可怜的、哀鸣的弱者，几乎不值得再看一眼。

Or, with that assumption, are we making a dangerous mistake?

或者，有了这个假设，我们是否犯了一个危险的错误？

I often encounter resistance around the concept of submission from successful women: Hey! I'm nobody's doormat girl.

我经常遇到成功女性对顺从概念的抗拒：嘿！我不是任何人的踏垫女孩。

And yet virtually every religion includes a practice designed to deliver us into a surrendered, inward-looking submissive state, whether it's meditation, asana, or prayer. Among themselves, writers and artists talk endlessly about how to penetrate the veil that separates them from their unconscious. And who among us hasn't been desperate for the opportunity to give ourselves over completely to a gifted lover, where our only job is to close our eyes and receive, receive, receive?

然而，几乎每一种宗教都包括一种旨在将我们带入投降的、向内看的顺从状态的实践，无论是冥想、体式还是祈祷。作家和艺术家之间无休止地谈论如何穿透将他们与无意识分开的面纱。我们中有谁不曾渴望有机会完全将自己交给一个有天赋的情人，在那里我们唯一的工作就是闭上眼睛，接收，接收，接收？

That is the submissive state I want you to envision, one in which you are completely and safely held by someone else's attention, and can therefore relax and concentrate only on what you feel. Your role as a submissive is to turn your attention inward, and to feel what you want so completely that every cell in your being is saturated with it.

这就是我想要你设想的顺从状态，一种你完全且安全地被别人的注意力所包围的状态，因此可以放松并只专注于你所感受到的。作为一个被支配者，你的角色是将注意力转向内，并完全感受你想要的东西，以至于你存在的每一个细胞都被它浸透。

"What does this have to do with power?" new students ask. The answer is that when you achieve this submissive state, where you are totally connected to your needs and have no resistance to receiving, you gain a legitimate feeling about those wants and needs.

"这与权力有什么关系？"新学生问。答案是，当你达到这种顺从状态时，你完全与你的需求连接，对接收没有任何抗拒，你就会对那些欲望和需求产生一种合法的感觉。

One of the most prevalent misconceptions I encounter is the idea that influence is achieved only through dominance. In fact, a person who is fully occupying the surrendered submissive state can very successfully influence another person because she knows exactly what she wants and what she needs. Her desire is pure, and will be expressed clearly because she feels it so strongly.

我遇到的最普遍的误解之一是，影响力只能通过支配来实现。事实上，一个完全占据投降的顺从状态的人可以非常成功地影响另一个人，因为她确切地知道她想要什么和需要什么。她的欲望是纯粹的，会清晰地表达出来，因为她如此强烈地感受到它。

Submission is not powerlessness, but connection.

顺从不是无力，而是连接。

This is why a request from the submissive state doesn't mean groveling. It simply means that you're asking with a profound connection to what you know to be true: "When I get more people on my team, I will be able to grow this business 25 percent by the end of the year." Or: "When I get home from the airport to find that you've drawn me a hot bath and poured me a glass of wine, I will feel like the most loved creature on the planet."

这就是为什么从顺从状态提出的要求并不意味着卑躬屈膝。它只是意味着你带着对你所知道的真相的深刻连接来提出要求："当我的团队有更多人时，我能够在年底前将业务增长25%。"或者："当我从机场回到家，发现你为我准备了一池热水浴并倒了一杯酒，我会感觉自己是地球上最被爱的生物。"

A few things to note here. First of all, these are both requests, and there's nothing passive about them. But they are requests made using submissive language—"I" language, emotional language with an exclusive focus on the speaker and her experience.

这里需要注意几点。首先，这些都是要求，没有什么被动的地方。但它们是用顺从语言提出的要求——"我"的语言，专注于说话者及其经历的情感语言。

And because in the submissive state a person's attention is turned in, toward herself, her body is also communicating from this submissive space. She might find herself touching herself as she speaks—placing a hand over her heart, for instance. Her body will be soft and pliant, and there will be a luxurious quality to her voice. She is not just telling the other person what her world would look and feel like if they said yes, but painting a picture for them with her whole self.

因为在顺从状态中，一个人的注意力向内转，朝向自己，她的身体也从这个顺从的空间中交流。她可能会发现自己说话时触摸自己——例如，把手放在心脏上。她的身体会柔软而柔韧，她的声音会有一种奢华的特质。她不仅仅是在告诉对方如果他们说"是"，她的世界会是什么样子和感觉，而是用整个自己为他们描绘一幅画面。

In the submissive state, you create a world in which your desires have already come true, and invite the other person to join you in it.

在顺从状态中，你创造了一个你的欲望已经实现的世界，并邀请另一个人加入你。

A submissive ask should feel very, very good.

一个顺从的要求应该感觉非常好。

Much of the time, the other person will agree to join you in the world you've created—the world where you have what you want—because a connected, submissive Ask has a fundamental integrity, a very powerful place from which to make a request or an invitation. Someone who is truly in the submissive state is a pleasure to help because she doesn't have any resistance to what's on offer. A person who is connected in this way is legible to others; her signal is crystal clear. Often she gets what she wants without even having to ask for it.

大多数时候，另一个人会同意加入你创造的世界——你拥有你想要的东西的世界——因为一个有连接的、顺从的要求具有基本的完整性，一个非常强大的位置，可以提出要求或邀请。真正处于顺从状态的人帮助起来很愉快，因为她对提供的东西没有任何抗拒。以这种方式连接的人对他人来说是清晰的；她的信号是水晶般清晰的。通常她甚至不需要问就能得到她想要的。

So when I advocate for the submissive state, I am not talking about sending women back to the Stone Age. We do, however, need to know what we're feeling.

所以当我提倡顺从状态时，我不是在谈论把女性送回石器时代。然而，我们确实需要知道我们的感受。

This is a message easily lost in our culture, for both men and women. One of the very first instructions we receive is that it's okay—indeed, expected—to lie about our feelings. "You may rejoin the group when you say you're sorry," your first-grade teacher tells you. You're not sorry, not at all, but it's cold and lonely in the corner. You don't want to be on the outside—nobody does. So you fake contrition and rejoin the herd.

在我们文化中，这对男性和女性来说都是一个容易丢失的信息。我们最早收到的指示之一是关于感受撒谎是可以的——实际上，是被期望的。"当你说你对不起时，你可以重新加入小组，"你的一年级老师告诉你。你并不抱歉，一点也不，但角落里又冷又孤独。你不想被排除在外——没有人想。所以你假装悔恨并重新加入群体。

This disconnection from our feelings and desires continues to be rewarded, especially for women. You ignore your hunger and skip dinner so you'll fit into the dress you bought for the eighth-grade dance, and keep your mouth shut when the intern coordinator who will write your recommendation tells an off-color joke. You injure your knee on a morning run you knew you were too tired and sore to do safely, and date men even though they don't do it for you. You take the job with the best benefits, not the one that makes your heart sing, and convince yourself that you can make a beach vacation work because it will make your husband and your kids happy, even though you hate the sand and the sun.

这种与我们的感受和欲望的脱节继续得到奖励，尤其是对女性来说。你忽视饥饿，跳过晚餐，这样你就能穿进为八年级舞会买的裙子，当会为你写推荐信的实习协调员讲了一个低俗笑话时，你保持沉默。你在一次晨跑中伤了膝盖，你知道自己太累太痛无法安全地跑步，你还是和那些对你来说不合适的人约会。你选择福利最好的工作，而不是让你心花怒放的工作，并说服自己可以接受海滩度假，因为它会让你丈夫和孩子高兴，即使你讨厌沙子和阳光。

And then someone like me asks you what you want, what's alive for you—not minor upgrades to the stuff you already have (more money, fewer pounds, a shorter commute), and not what's going to satisfy your peers or your parents or your partner or your children or your church or your political party or your clients or the people who work for you—and you come to realize that you have absolutely no idea, and no idea how to find out.

然后像我这样的人问你你想要什么，什么对你是活的——不是你已经拥有的东西的小升级（更多钱，更少的体重，更短的通勤），也不是会满足你的同龄人或你的父母或你的伴侣或你的孩子或你的教会或你的政党或你的客户或为你工作的人的东西——你意识到你完全不知道，也不知道如何找出答案。

Over a lifetime of ignoring our own basic inner cues, we lose touch with what we're actually thinking and feeling. We go numb. We lose discernment, the understanding that subtle differences make a difference that isn't subtle at all. We lose our connection to the inner signal—to the life force itself.

经过一生忽视我们自己的基本内在线索，我们失去了与我们的实际想法和感受的联系。我们变得麻木。我们失去了辨别力，失去了对微妙差异产生绝不小差异的理解。我们失去了与内在信号的联系——与生命力本身的联系。

And that's no good: We need to know what we are feeling.

这不好：我们需要知道我们的感受。

We must be alert to our inner signal, attentive to its spirit and to the information it carries. This space is where the treasure lies. It is the place from which our deepest desires, the ones that fuel our destiny and feed our life force, are born.

我们必须对内在信号保持警觉，关注它的精神和它携带的信息。这个空间是宝藏所在的地方。这是我们最深的欲望，那些为我们的命运提供动力并滋养我们生命力的欲望，诞生的地方。

These deepest desires may not noisily announce themselves. They may appear as nothing more than a vague impulse, a feeling you can't quite settle into, a shapeless longing that takes the form of dissatisfaction and the vague suspicion that there has to be something more. These desires may seem mysterious or confusing, contradictory or impossible at first.

这些最深的欲望可能不会大声宣告自己。它们可能只表现为一个模糊的冲动，一个你无法完全沉浸的感觉，一个以不满和隐约怀疑必须有更多东西的形式出现的无形状的渴望。这些欲望起初可能显得神秘或令人困惑，矛盾或不可能。

It will always be easier to ignore them, to bypass the uncertainty they arouse—indeed, many of us spend a lifetime doing it. But whatever ideas you hatch without connection to that deep inner signal will always run the risk of lifelessness. Desires born from true connection carry the vital spark of something essential, something unique, something only you can bring into the world. Think of the difference between a cheap plastic bowl, made with thousands of others in a factory with a history of human-rights violations, and one that is hand-thrown with craft, beautifully glazed, and fired with intention.

忽略它们，绕过它们引起的不确定性，总是更容易——事实上，我们中的许多人花了一生时间这样做。但是，任何没有与那个深层内在信号连接的想法都总是冒着无生命力的风险。从真正连接中诞生的欲望携带着某种本质、某种独特、只有你能带入世界的生命火花。想想一个廉价的塑料碗，在一个人权侵犯历史的工厂里与数千个其他碗一起制作，和一个用手工制作、精美上釉、有意烧制的碗之间的区别。

The primary superpower of the submissive is her ability to connect to a deep inner signal and to communicate the truth of that signal to others.

被支配者的主要超能力是她能够连接到深层内在信号，并向他人传达该信号的真相。

We will spend some time in this book accessing the submissive space in order to get back in touch with our inner signal, with an eye to unearthing some of those deep-rooted desires. If we don't know what we want, then what is the point of having influence? To be able to buy a bunch of crap we think we should have? To do and be what others expect us to do and be—only better? That's not power.

我们将在这本书中花一些时间进入顺从空间，以便重新与内在信号联系，着眼于发掘一些那些根深蒂固的欲望。如果我们不知道我们想要什么，那么拥有影响力又有什么意义呢？为了能够买一堆我们认为应该拥有的垃圾？为了做和成为别人期望我们做和成为的——只是更好？那不是权力。

But if we use this powerful sub state to connect to our deepest desires, then a whole world opens. We gain a legitimate feeling about our desires and about our right to ask. The emotions we're not supposed to feel—rage, shame, fear—have a tremendous amount of energy tied up in them; this sub state is how we access and alchemize those emotions, so we can harness that energy for good. It gives us the chance to explore our own resistance, which will help us to navigate it when we encounter it in others. And it leads to the most transformative force we have access to: self-celebration.

但如果我们使用这种强大的顺从状态来连接到我们最深的欲望，那么整个世界就会打开。我们对我们的欲望和我们的要求权利产生了一种合法的感觉。我们不应该感受的情感——愤怒、羞耻、恐惧——有大量的能量困在其中；这种顺从状态是我们如何获取和炼金这些情感的方式，这样我们就可以利用这些能量为善。它给我们机会探索我们自己的抗拒，这将帮助我们在他人中遇到它时导航它。它引导我们走向我们可获得的最具变革性的力量：自我庆祝。

We are here to use the life force, to ride its momentum to the sun. Accessing the submissive space is how you will tap into its riches. To open that treasure chest, you must turn your attention inward.

我们在这里是为了使用生命力，骑乘它的动量朝向太阳。进入顺从空间是你将如何挖掘其财富的方式。要打开那个宝藏箱，你必须将注意力转向内。

### In Good Hands: The Power of the Dominant State of Attention | 在好手中：支配状态注意力的力量

What comes to mind when you hear the word "dominance"?

当你听到"支配"这个词时，你会想到什么？

Do you imagine a woman clad in sky-high leather boots and a corset, brandishing a whip?

你是否想象一个穿着高跟皮靴和紧身胸衣，挥舞着鞭子的女人？

Given how unskilled most people are at managing these dynamics, it's more likely that other, less comely images come to mind, like the bullying father who "taught" you to swim by tossing you, terrified, straight into the deep end. A domineering manager, rampaging through the office, leaving a poisonous cloud of negativity and fear in her wake. An ex who controlled through manipulation, leaving you feeling diminished and wrong-footed, no matter what you said or did.

鉴于大多数人在管理这些动态方面是多么不熟练，更可能的是，其他不那么美好的形象浮现在脑海中，比如那个"教"你游泳的霸凌父亲，他把你吓得直接扔进深水区。一个专横的经理，在办公室里横冲直撞，在她身后留下一片负面情绪和恐惧的毒云。一个通过操纵控制的前任，无论你说什么或做什么，都让你感到被贬低和措手不及。

We call these "bad dommes." True dominance, as you have no doubt gathered by now, has absolutely nothing to do with cruelty. A firefighter dousing a fire is using a dominant state of attention; so is a skilled massage therapist and a good mom. And a dominatrix! (Although only the good ones.)

我们称这些为"坏女支配者"。真正的支配，正如你现在毫无疑问已经理解的，与残酷完全无关。消防员灭火时使用的是支配状态的注意力；熟练的按摩治疗师和好妈妈也是如此。还有女支配者！（虽然只有好的那种。）

A truly dominant state simply has to do with the flow of attention—attention out.

真正的支配状态仅仅与注意力的流动有关——注意力向外。

You'll note that I say "out," as opposed to "outward," because that is how I want you to think of it. Your attention goes out, onto, and into someone else's body. In this case, "out" is not a direction or a suggestion, but a location. Because, as we will see, big communication problems arise when you aren't completely and fully occupying one state of attention or the other.

你会注意到我说"向外"，而不是"向外"，因为这就是我想让你这样想它的方式。你的注意力向外，到，并进入另一个人的身体。在这种情况下，"向外"不是方向或建议，而是位置。因为，正如我们将看到的，当你没有完全和充分地占据一种或另一种注意力状态时，就会出现大的沟通问题。

A screaming boss storming through the office may be offering plenty of instruction and dominant language, for instance, but her attention, however miserable it's making you, is turned inward on her own rage and fear and inadequacy. She may be yelling, "Never do this again," but her animal body is saying, "Look what you did to me!"

一个咆哮的老板在办公室里横冲直撞，可能会提供大量的指令和支配性语言，例如，但她的注意力，无论让你多么痛苦，都向内转向她自己的愤怒、恐惧和不充分感。她可能在喊叫，"永远不要再这样做，"但她的动物身体在说，"看看你对我做了什么！"

This is incongruence—the disconnect between behavior and the state of attention. Your boss is domineering, but not dominant. She's not curious about you, about your capability or talents or capacity, as a good domme would be. She's not sensing and testing, assessing your responses to her corrections, or helping you to determine whether your resistance serves your ultimate goals or holds you back. She may be using the language of authority, but she will never have real influence until she puts her attention out.

这是不一致——行为与注意力状态之间的脱节。你的老板是专横的，但不是支配的。她对你、对你的能力、才能或容量不感兴趣，就像一个好女支配者会那样。她不在感知和测试，评估你对她的纠正的反应，或帮助你确定你的抗拒是否服务于你的最终目标或阻碍你。她可能在使用权威的语言，但除非她把注意力向外，否则她永远不会有真正的影响力。

I saw this, over and over, when I was training less experienced dominatrices. A woman would look the part, but if her attention was turned in on herself, then all the custom-fitted latex in Germany wouldn't be enough to compensate for what her animal body was communicating.

我看到这一点，一遍又一遍，当我训练经验不足的女支配者时。一个女人看起来像那么回事，但如果她的注意力向内转向自己，那么德国所有定制的乳胶都不足以补偿她的动物身体正在传达的东西。

True power isn't performative.

真正的权力不是表演性的。

"They taught me what to say," students often complain to me after they've taken a negotiation seminar. "And it worked great in the classroom. How come it falls flat when I try to use it in real life?" The answer is that they're using dominant language without directing their attention.

"他们教我说什么，"学生们在参加谈判研讨会后经常向我抱怨。"在课堂上效果很好。为什么当我试图在现实生活中使用它时，它就失效了？"答案是，他们在使用支配性语言而没有引导他们的注意力。

Indeed, this confusion about the flow of attention is also why so much of the advice on women in the workplace dilutes women's access to power instead of strengthening it. Instead of showing women how to turn their attention out and keep it there, all those helpful instructions about what to wear, what to say, and how to say it turn a woman's attention back onto herself. This amplifies women's destructive self-policing tendencies, exacerbating the problem instead of solving it.

事实上，这种关于注意力流动的困惑也是为什么关于女性在工作场所的如此多建议削弱了女性获得权力的机会而不是加强它。不是向女性展示如何将注意力向外并保持在那里，所有那些关于穿什么、说什么以及如何说的有用指示都将女性的注意力转回到自己身上。这放大了女性破坏性的自我监管倾向，使问题恶化而不是解决它。

To dominate another person, you have to turn—and keep—your attention out. You hold them in the tractor beam of your attention and guide the conversation from there, determining what subjects are being discussed, what actions will be taken or prevented, what corrections will be made.

为了支配另一个人，你必须将——并保持——你的注意力向外。你用注意力的牵引光束将他们固定住，并从那里引导对话，确定正在讨论什么主题，将采取或阻止什么行动，将进行什么纠正。

Later in this book, we will spend some time training you to assume and hold the dominant state; for reasons I will explain, the default state of attention for women is in. But we can begin here by introducing you to dominant language.

在本书的后面，我们将花一些时间训练你承担并保持支配状态；由于我将解释的原因，女性的默认注意力状态是向内。但我们可以在这里通过向你介绍支配性语言来开始。

Begin sentences with the pronoun "you"—"You will," "You can," "You are," "You get to." Be concise; don't explain your motivation for asking. Give extremely specific instructions, telling the other person exactly what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. So instead of "Be more romantic," you will say, "Clear your schedule on Sunday night and take me for dinner at Lapérouse." Leave "I" language out of it entirely; your attention is on them.

以代词"你"开始句子——"你将，"你可以，"你是，"你会得到。"要简洁；不要解释你要求的动机。给出极其具体的指令，准确地告诉另一个人要做什么，如何做，以及何时做。所以，不要说"更浪漫一点，"你会说，"在周日晚清理你的日程，带我去拉佩鲁斯吃晚餐。"完全不要使用"我"的语言；你的注意力在他们身上。

If you absolutely must insert yourself, use third-party language instead of the word "I." For instance: "Organizations benefit," "Studies show," "A woman really appreciates a man who," "A relationship flourishes when." This may sound awkward and stiff, not at all the way you ordinarily talk. That's not surprising, given how many of us default to apology and softened language when we ask for something.

如果你绝对必须插入自己，使用第三人称语言而不是"我"这个词。例如："组织受益，"研究显示，"女人真的欣赏一个男人，"当关系蓬勃发展时。"这听起来可能尴尬和僵硬，完全不是你通常说话的方式。这并不奇怪，考虑到我们中有多少人在要求某物时默认道歉和柔和的语言。

Dominant language on its own isn't enough; ultimately, the person you are dominating will be responding as much to the weight of your attention as it is transmitted by your posture, the steadiness of your gaze, and the timbre of your voice—one animal body communicating with another—as to what you say. True domination will come only when the authority of your animal body has commanded someone else's animal body, leaving them comfortable and relaxed enough to move into a more submissive state, so that they can accept your correction and instruction.

支配性语言本身是不够的；最终，你正在支配的人将对你的注意力的重量做出回应，就像它通过你的姿势、你凝视的稳定性和你声音的音色传递的那样——一个动物身体与另一个动物身体交流——就像你说的那样。真正的支配只有在你的动物身体的权威命令了另一个人的动物身体时才会到来，让他们足够舒适和放松，进入更顺从的状态，这样他们就可以接受你的纠正和指示。

In that case, it won't matter what you say, so much as how you say it. And because your attention is out, you will see how your suggestions and corrections land with the other person. (A truly embodied domme's attention is so far outward that she practically disappears to herself.) This focused attentiveness is the real gift of the dominant state of attention.

在这种情况下，你说什么并不重要，更重要的是你如何说。因为你的注意力向外，你会看到你的建议和纠正如何与另一个人落地。（一个真正体现的女支配者的注意力是如此向外，以至于她实际上对自己消失了。）这种专注的注意力是支配状态注意力的真正礼物。

With the information you harvest through your attentiveness, you will know exactly how caring, ruthless, truth-telling, funny, formal, strict, or playful to be. It's through attention that you will know exactly what's needed, not because you've been told what "should" be the right next step.

通过你的注意力收集的信息，你会确切地知道如何变得关心、无情、说真话、有趣、正式、严格或顽皮。正是通过注意力，你会确切地知道需要什么，不是因为有人告诉你"应该"是下一步的正确步骤。

If the other person's shoulders are hunched in protection and their face is frozen and non-expressive, for instance, then you will know they are guarding themselves, which will in turn suggest that you offer a soft introduction to the hard truth you're about to deliver. A scattered, disoriented state—which the other person may reveal to you through a series of erratic, skittish movements—might require a grounding statement, a description of what's happening right now: "It seems like my comment has upset you." An inability to make or maintain eye contact is often an indication of shame, which might require a judicious application of charm and humor.

例如，如果另一个人的肩膀因保护而耸起，他们的脸是僵硬的、没有表情的，那么你会知道他们在保护自己，这反过来会建议你为你即将传达的硬道理提供一个温和的介绍。一个分散、迷失方向的状态——另一个人可能通过一系列不稳定的、胆怯的动作向你揭示——可能需要一个接地声明，描述现在正在发生什么："看起来我的评论让你不安了。"无法建立或保持眼神接触通常是羞耻的迹象，这可能需要对魅力和幽默的明智运用。

Charm and humor might also be a good way to disarm a raised voice and aggressive body posture. But this is why these are not prescriptions: if you see X, do Y; a joke might infuriate someone who's already agitated. With your attention out, you will know that you haven't hit the mark, and pick up clues as to what might work better—a sharp instruction, for instance, or a hug. Trust your animal body to know what is required; it will, if you keep your attention out. And you will know it is working because you will see the other person's body change—a thousand microexpressions to indicate softening and trust.

魅力和幽默也可能是解除高音和攻击性身体姿势的好方法。但这就是为什么这些不是处方：如果你看到X，做Y；一个笑话可能会激怒已经激动的人。如果你的注意力向外，你会知道你没有击中目标，并收集线索，了解什么可能更有效——例如，一个尖锐的指令，或一个拥抱。相信你的动物身体知道需要什么；如果你保持注意力向外，它会知道的。你会知道它是有效的，因为你会看到另一个人的身体变化——一千个微表情表明软化和信任。

When I was training new dominatrices, I noticed that they were often quite oblivious to what was really going on with the other person in the room. Because they were self-conscious, they were missing the more subtle reactions, signals that the other person had gotten triggered or lost or shut down. They didn't notice when a client's shoulders melted, or his face relaxed, indicating that they could push further. And they weren't attentive to bracing or flinching or retraction, warnings that they were moving too fast or too hard.

当我训练新的女支配者时，我注意到她们经常对房间里另一个人真正发生的事情视而不见。因为她们自我意识强，她们错过了更微妙的反应，信号表明另一个人被触发、迷失或关闭。她们没有注意到客户的肩膀融化了，或者他的脸放松了，表明她们可以进一步推动。她们不注意支撑、退缩或回缩，警告她们移动得太快或太用力。

We are not encouraged to think or talk about what our animal bodies know. It's considered woo-woo; it's not science. And yet, imagine going back a hundred years and telling your great-grandmother that she needed to stay hydrated; she would have looked at you like you were completely insane. If your great-grandmother was fortunate enough to have access to clean water, she drank when she was thirsty. But because we are so out of touch with our inner signal, we can no longer be trusted to do that anymore, so we police our bodies with smart water bottles connected to apps that remind us to drink, or rules about how many ounces we need to choke down every day.

我们不鼓励思考或谈论我们的动物身体知道什么。这被认为是胡言乱语；这不是科学。然而，想象一下回到一百年前，告诉你的曾祖母她需要保持水分；她会看着你，就像你完全疯了。如果你的曾祖母足够幸运能够获得干净的水，她在口渴时喝水。但是因为我们与内在信号如此脱节，我们不再被信任这样做，所以我们用连接到应用程序的智能水瓶来监管我们的身体，提醒我们喝水，或者关于我们每天需要吞下多少盎司的规则。

With this dimming of our awareness of our own inner signal, of course it's difficult for us to feel where another person is at—especially during a difficult conversation, when emotions are running high on both sides. Many times, in a high-stakes conflict situation, people don't know how they themselves feel. But if influence is your goal, then it is essential to know what is really going on with the other person. And the best way to do this is to get your brain out of the way, so your animal body can do the feeling.

随着我们对内在信号意识的减弱，当然对我们来说很难感觉到另一个人在哪里——尤其是在困难的对话中，当双方情绪都很高涨时。很多时候，在高风险的冲突情况下，人们不知道他们自己感觉如何。但如果影响力是你的目标，那么了解另一个人真正发生的事情是至关重要的。最好的方法是让你的大脑让路，这样你的动物身体就可以做感觉。

We will train so you can stay there. You will learn to resist the tendency to recoil back into yourself when a situation becomes difficult, or when you hear the word "no," because recoiling puts the attention back onto you—your pain, your right to ask, and the feelings you're having about the rejection—not on your desire, or what you've asked for, and certainly not on how you can move the other person.

我们将训练你，这样你就可以留在那里。你将学会抵抗在情况变得困难时，或当你听到"不"这个词时，退缩回自己的倾向，因为退缩将注意力转回到你身上——你的痛苦、你的要求权利，以及你对拒绝的感受——而不是你的欲望，或你要求的，当然也不是你如何能够移动另一个人。

The moment you lose connection, you lose control and influence.

失去连接的瞬间，你就失去了控制和影响力。

From the dominant state of attention, you can locate the other person—figure out what's going on with them—and help them to locate themselves. You can ask for anything. And because attention out gives you exquisite sensitivity to the reactions of the other person, you can surf their resistance until you arrive at a solution.

从支配状态的注意力，你可以定位另一个人——弄清楚他们发生了什么——并帮助他们定位自己。你可以要求任何东西。因为注意力向外给你对另一个人反应的精妙敏感度，你可以驾驭他们的抗拒，直到你到达一个解决方案。

This is how you lead another person, heart, mind, and soul.

这就是你如何引导另一个人，心、思想和灵魂。

### Attention Out—Without Influence | 注意力向外——没有影响力

"Hold on!" some of you are thinking. "I feel like my attention is out all the time! I'm always alert to how everyone on my team is feeling. If anything, I'm hypervigilant to who needs a snack or a word of praise, and what needs to happen next."

"等等！"你们中的一些人正在想。"我觉得我的注意力一直在外！我总是警觉团队中每个人的感受。如果有的话，我对谁需要零食或一句赞美，以及接下来需要发生什么过度警觉。"

This type of attentiveness is very common, especially for women, but it's not dominance. It is attention out, without influence—no persuasive communication takes place.

这种类型的注意力非常常见，尤其是对女性来说，但它不是支配。它是注意力向外，没有影响力——没有说服性交流发生。

We've seen what happens when someone exhibits so-called dominant behavior without attention out: this is the mansplainer lecturing a woman about a book she herself researched and wrote; the boring professor who drones on and on without checking in to make sure his students are engrossed; the lover who bangs away, oblivious to his partner's responses and needs.

我们已经看到当某人表现出所谓的支配行为而没有注意力向外时会发生什么：这是男性说教者向一个女人讲授她研究和写的书；无聊的教授不停地喋喋不休，没有检查以确保他的学生全神贯注；情人猛烈地撞击，无视他伴侣的反应和需求。

Women do this too, sometimes—think, for instance, of the stage mom whose own ambitions supersede the happiness of her child. But in my experience, it is much more common for women to exhibit attention out without influence, which often means without instruction.

女性有时也会这样做——例如，想想那个自己的野心超越孩子快乐的舞台妈妈。但根据我的经验，女性更常见的是表现出注意力向外而没有影响力，这通常意味着没有指示。

Looking around a cocktail party to confirm that you're dressed appropriately is fine if that's the information you need, but it isn't a dominant state of attention. Patiently listening and holding space for a friend who just got back from her dad's funeral is a kind and loving and wonderful thing to do, but it is not a dominant state of attention, either.

在鸡尾酒会上环顾四周以确认你穿着得体，如果这是你需要的信息，那是可以的，但这不是支配状态的注意力。耐心倾听并为刚从父亲葬礼回来的朋友保持空间是一种善良、有爱和美妙的事情，但这不是支配状态的注意力。

In the dominant state of attention, your job is not just to see the person in the submissive role in the dynamic, but to move them.

在支配状态的注意力中，你的工作不仅仅是看到动态中处于顺从角色的人，而是移动他们。

It is only when you combine attention out with instruction—which may take the form of a seductive invitation, a playful suggestion, a stern correction, a demand, a request, or a direct order, and everything in between—that you have influence.

只有当你将注意力向外与指示结合起来时——这可能采取诱人的邀请、顽皮的建议、严厉的纠正、要求、请求或直接命令的形式，以及介于两者之间的一切——你才会有影响力。

Dominance and Submission | 支配与顺从

A RECAP | 总结

I once watched a nine-pound cat "dominate" a seventy-pound pit bull without moving a single centimeter from her loaf position on a chair. What happened between them that had this dog bowing and whimpering and hiding behind his owner like he'd been kicked? And what does that cat know that we've forgotten?

我曾经看过一只九磅重的猫"支配"一只七十磅重的斗牛犬，而她自己坐在椅子上的面包位置上一厘米都没有移动。它们之间发生了什么，让这只狗鞠躬、呜咽，像被踢了一样躲在主人身后？那只猫知道什么而我们忘记了？

Let's recap some of the attributes we find in the dominant and submissive states of attention.

让我们总结一下我们在支配和顺从状态的注意力中发现的一些属性。

When a woman is in the dominant state of attention, her attention is out. A domme is commanding, and leads the interaction. She is dedicated to staying on course, and her empathy is used for information-gathering: she keeps her attention out so that she doesn't miss anything. With her body language and gaze and tone of voice, she penetrates into the space of the other person. She is curious when facing resistance, and asks probing questions in order to get to the heart of her sub's defiance. She uses everything that comes up, and uses even unwanted responses to move the interaction forward. She calibrates her own responses—using a light touch or more pressure, all the way up to a stern call-out—depending on the information she gathers from looking at the body of the other person and listening to their tone of voice. She uses "you" language; gives direct, specific, and concise instruction; and keeps herself out of the conversation.

当一个女人处于支配状态的注意力时，她的注意力向外。一个女支配者是命令性的，并引导互动。她致力于保持在轨道上，她的同理心用于信息收集：她保持注意力向外，这样她不会错过任何东西。通过她的身体语言、凝视和语调，她渗透到另一个人的空间。面对抗拒时，她是好奇的，并问深入的问题，以便深入到她被支配者反抗的核心。她使用出现的所有东西，甚至使用不想要的回应来推动互动向前。她校准自己的回应——使用轻触或更多压力，一直到严厉的指出——取决于她从观察另一个人的身体和听他们的语调收集的信息。她使用"你"的语言；给出直接、具体和简洁的指示；并让自己远离对话。

When a woman is in the submissive space, her attention is in, on her own emotions, physical sensations, and experience. She is in touch with what she wants. Indeed, she is so connected as to be unshakable. She is open to inviting others to join her in creating the great vision she finds within herself, and is able to paint a picture for them of that vision that makes their participation irresistible. She uses "I" language; her soft gaze and body language reflect the flow of her attention, which is in. She is ready to receive from the other person without any bracing—questions of whether she qualifies or what she deserves or what she will owe. She stays focused on what she wants, even when distractions occur.

当一个女人处于顺从空间时，她的注意力向内，专注于她自己的情感、身体感觉和经历。她与她想要的联系。确实，她如此连接以至于不可动摇。她愿意邀请他人加入她，共同创造她在自己内心发现的伟大愿景，并能够为他们描绘那幅愿景的画面，使他们的参与不可抗拒。她使用"我"的语言；她柔和的目光和身体语言反映了她注意力的流动，这是向内的。她准备好从另一个人那里接收，没有任何支撑——关于她是否有资格或她应得什么或她将欠什么的问题。她专注于她想要的，即使干扰发生。

Remember: The direction of your attention is the only one of these rules that really matters; I can (and have!) dominated people very successfully while curled up in the fetal position and using only "I" statements.

记住：你注意力的方向是这些规则中真正重要的唯一一个；我可以（并且已经！）在蜷缩成胎儿姿势时非常成功地支配人们，只使用"我"的陈述。

None of these rules will work if your attention is not properly directed. These are simply observations of behaviors that people tend to exhibit in a dominant or submissive state—not rules you must follow in order to get there.

如果你的注意力没有正确引导，这些规则都不会起作用。这些只是对人们在支配或顺从状态下倾向于表现出的行为的观察——不是你为了到达那里而必须遵循的规则。

### Best of Both Worlds: Flipping the Switch | 两全其美：切换开关

There's an energetic partner exercise in Taoism called "Pushing Hands," which is more or less what it sounds like: partners seamlessly switch between pushing and being pushed—between dominance and submission. Done properly, it's a dance: force is both applied and absorbed so subtly by both parties that the four hands seem almost to be moving themselves.

道教中有一个充满活力的搭档练习叫做"推手"，这或多或少就是它听起来的样子：搭档之间无缝切换推动和被推动——在支配和顺从之间。做得恰当，这是一支舞蹈：力量被双方如此微妙地应用和吸收，以至于四只手似乎几乎在自动移动。

You don't have to choose between being a good domme or a good sub.

你不必在选择成为一个好女支配者或一个好被支配者之间选择。

Become adept at both, and you can choose the state of attention appropriate for the occasion—a "switch."

熟练掌握两者，你可以选择适合场合的注意力状态——一个"开关"。

You're already practicing this; in healthy dynamics, this switching happens effortlessly and without calling attention to itself, all the time. Every really great conversation you've ever had, the kind where you hear and feel heard, has been a beautiful dance between dominance and submission.

你已经在这方面练习了；在健康的动态中，这种切换总是毫不费力地发生，不会引起注意。你曾经拥有的每一次真正伟大的对话，那种你听到和被听到的感觉，都是支配和顺从之间的美丽舞蹈。

Say you and a friend sit down over a glass of wine; you can't wait to tell her the funny interaction you witnessed on the way over. As you tell your story, you are watching your friend, noticing if she's happily engaged with what you're saying, or if her mind has wandered. A good domme, you take note of what makes her smile, and throw in a little more of that, to make her laugh.

假设你和朋友坐下来喝一杯酒；你迫不及待地想告诉她你在路上目睹的有趣互动。当你讲故事时，你正在观察你的朋友，注意她是否愉快地参与你所说的话，或者她的思绪是否已经漫游。作为一个好女支配者，你注意到什么让她微笑，并多加入一些，让她笑。

As your friend listens, her attention is inward, checking with herself to see how your words land. Does she understand what you mean? Does she agree or disagree? How does what you're saying feel to her?

当你的朋友倾听时，她的注意力向内，与自己核对，看看你的话如何落地。她理解你的意思吗？她同意还是不同意？你所说的话对她来说感觉如何？

Then something you say prompts a memory or an anecdote, and suddenly, she begins to speak. As she assumes the dominant role, her attention moves out. Now she's watching you, judging the impact of what she's sharing, adjusting her words in accordance with your understanding and mood.

然后你说的一些东西引发了记忆或轶事，突然，她开始说话。当她承担支配角色时，她的注意力向外移动。现在她正在观察你，判断她分享的内容的影响，根据你的理解和情绪调整她的话语。

Please note: At no point are you or your friend half in and half out of a dominant or submissive state of attention. Whichever state of attention you are occupying, you are occupying it completely.

请注意：你或你的朋友在任何时候都不会半进半出支配或顺从状态的注意力。无论你处于哪种注意力状态，你都是完全占据它的。

I've broken this conversation down in a painstaking way to illustrate the point, but of course, in a really good conversation, this switching happens seamlessly and fluidly. Most interesting of all? You feel like equals at that table, but your conversation is working precisely because, moment to moment, you are not. What you're really doing is fluently and easily switching—from top to bottom, dominance to submission.

我以细致的方式分解了这个对话来说明这一点，但当然，在一个真正好的对话中，这种切换无缝流畅地发生。最有趣的是什么？你在那张桌子上感觉像平等，但你的对话之所以有效，正是因为，时时刻刻，你并不是平等的。你真正在做的是流畅轻松地切换——从上到下，从支配到顺从。

This dance is essential. Without this polarity, there's no movement, no life to your conversation.

这种舞蹈是必要的。没有这种极性，就没有运动，你的对话就没有生命。

The dynamic between two people has to move.

两个人之间的动态必须移动。

If your friend were to spend the entire dinner telling you about her own life without ever checking in with you, then she'd be deathly boring. Conversely, if you never took the reins in order to offer your own thoughts and impressions, she'd leave your interaction depleted and resentful; you'd be dead weight in the dynamic.

如果你的朋友在整个晚餐过程中告诉你她自己的生活，而从未与你核对，那么她会极其无聊。相反，如果你从不掌舵来提供你自己的想法和印象，她会让你对她的互动感到疲惫和怨恨；你会在动态中成为累赘。

This is true about every working relationship and every romantic one; it is true about every sexual encounter, every negotiation, every creative collaboration, and every Thanksgiving dinner. And when relationships or dynamics get stuck—any time there's a lack of connection and intimacy and movement—it's generally because fixity has set in.

这对每一种工作关系和每一种浪漫关系都是如此；这对每一次性接触、每一次谈判、每一次创造性合作和每一次感恩节晚餐都是如此。当关系或动态陷入困境时——任何时候缺乏连接、亲密和运动——通常是因为固定性已经形成。

This is a Taoist principle, and the truest thing I know. In Chinese medicine, stagnation is the cause of all illness. The yin/yang symbol—the circle with the swervy line separating the light and the dark?—is a representation of a wheel in motion. Life must move.

这是道教原则，也是我所知道的最真实的事情。在中医中，停滞是所有疾病的根源。阴阳符号——带有分隔光明和黑暗的弯曲线条的圆圈？——是运动中轮子的代表。生命必须移动。

When I first started teaching power to women, I used yin and yang to describe the two states of attention, as opposed to submission and dominance. It was a beautiful teaching tool when applied to relationship dynamics because it revealed the little bit of surrender—the yin—inside the domme, the yang; and the strength and immovable truth—the yang—inside the yin, or the sub.

当我刚开始向女性教授权力时，我使用阴阳来描述两种注意力状态，而不是顺从和支配。当应用于关系动态时，这是一个美丽的教学工具，因为它揭示了女支配者（阳）内部的一点投降——阴；以及阴或被支配者内部的强度和不可移动的真理——阳。

But as far as changing behavior is concerned, talking to a room full of Western women about yin and yang was like talking to zebras about city planning. So I put my dominatrix boots on. When I talked about dominance and submission—even as states of attention—I could see the bodies of the women I was training understand what I meant far more effectively than they had when I talked about concepts borrowed from an ancient Eastern spiritual tradition.

但就改变行为而言，向一屋子西方女性谈论阴阳就像向斑马谈论城市规划一样。所以我穿上我的女支配者靴子。当我谈论支配和顺从时——即使是作为注意力状态——我可以看到我训练的女性的身体理解我的意思，这比我谈论借自古东方精神传统的概念时更有效。

The terms may be different, but the conclusion is the same: fixity is death. Sometimes, what would serve a relationship best is for a sub to step up, turn her attention out, and tell you what she wants. Sometimes a domme needs to quiet down and get connected to her own desire, letting someone else drive.

术语可能不同，但结论是一样的：固定性是死亡。有时，对关系最有利的是让被支配者站出来，将注意力向外转，告诉你她想要什么。有时女支配者需要安静下来，连接到她自己的欲望，让别人开车。

As we will see, the states strengthen each other. And it's not about one state of attention being stronger or weaker than the other; it's about which we use when, and for what.

正如我们将看到的，这些状态相互加强。这不是关于一种注意力状态比另一种更强或更弱；而是关于我们在什么时候使用哪一种，以及为了什么。

#### EXERCISE | 练习

##### See and Be Seen: The Description Exercise | 看见和被看见：描述练习

I'm going to end this chapter with something that feels really good, an exercise that we do six or seven times over the course of a weekend class. It's a simple way to explore the power dynamics that we have discussed in this chapter—and to explore working with another person.

我将用一些真正好的东西来结束这一章，一个我们在周末课程中做六七次的练习。这是一种探索我们在本章讨论的权力动态的简单方法——也是探索与他人合作的简单方法。

In class, the group splits into pairs, with one person standing to assume the dominant state of attention. The submissive partner silently raises her face to receive her partner's attention, as the dominant partner begins to describe her: "You have two eyes. You have two arms." She continues describing her partner in detail—her eyebrows, lashes, freckles, lips, earrings, tattoos, the expression on her face—all the time using the weight of her voice and gaze and attention to hold her partner and keep her safe.

在课堂上，小组分成对，一个人站着承担支配状态的注意力。顺从的搭档默默地抬起脸来接收她搭档的注意力，而支配的搭档开始描述她："你有两只眼睛。你有两只手臂。"她继续详细描述她的搭档——她的眉毛、睫毛、雀斑、嘴唇、耳环、纹身、她脸上的表情——一直使用她声音、凝视和注意力的重量来固定她的搭档并保持她安全。

Each sentence begins with "You." The word "you" helps direct more of the dominant partner's attention outward. She does this until there is a visible shift in the other woman's body—until she sees the sub move into herself.

每个句子都以"你"开始。"你"这个词帮助引导更多支配搭档的注意力向外。她这样做直到另一个女人的身体有明显的变化——直到她看到被支配者移入自己。

The language is intentionally simple. There is no judgment or instruction, just the dominant guidance of attention to the submissive's being. When the dominant says, "You just smiled," it makes the sub's smile even bigger. When she tells her, "You have brown hair," it is not a command or an attempt to influence, just the energetics of attention in its simplest form: she is using her own attention—attention out—to guide the sub's attention into herself.

语言是故意简单的。没有判断或指示，只是对顺从者存在的注意力支配性引导。当支配者说，"你刚刚笑了，"这让被支配者的笑容更大。当她告诉她，"你有棕色头发，"这不是命令或影响的尝试，只是注意力能量学的最简单形式：她使用自己的注意力——注意力向外——来引导被支配者的注意力进入她自己。

Then they switch.

然后他们切换。

I use this exercise to change the energy in the room, and the walls virtually hum with it when we're done. The women who took the dominant role last exude a quiet, calm control—they feel like safety personified. And the submissives, eyes sparkling against their flushed skin, look as refreshed as if they'd spent a day at the spa. They are transformed, physically, in a way a child could recognize—simply because they've basked in someone else's careful, dedicated attention for a few moments, because they've been well and truly seen.

我用这个练习来改变房间里的能量，当我们完成时，墙壁几乎在嗡嗡作响。最后承担支配角色的女性散发出安静、平静的控制——她们感觉像安全的化身。而被支配者，眼睛在她们涨红的皮肤上闪闪发光，看起来就像在spa度过了一天一样清爽。她们在身体上发生了转变，这种方式连孩子都能认出——仅仅因为她们在别人的细心、专注的注意力中沐浴了片刻，因为她们被很好地真正地看到了。

The exercise takes about four minutes, tops. But every time I watch the women in my classes do it—as I watch them move from resistance to relief—I am reminded of the tremendous, evolutionary, revolutionary potential of mastering both states of attention in a power dynamic.

这个练习大约需要四分钟，最多。但每次我看着课堂上的女性做它——当我看着她们从抗拒到解脱——我都会想起在权力动态中掌握两种注意力状态的巨大、进化的、革命的潜力。

By the end of a weekend together, the women in the room have done this exercise so many times that they no longer need language. Indeed, on the very last day, participants find a new partner, someone they've never done the exercise with before. In under a minute, using only eye contact, the two of them will wordlessly decide which one of them will assume the dominant state of attention first.

在周末结束时，房间里的女性已经做了这个练习这么多次，以至于她们不再需要语言。确实，在最后一天，参与者找到一个新搭档，一个她们从未一起做过这个练习的人。在不到一分钟的时间里，只使用眼神接触，她们两个会无言地决定她们中的哪一个将首先承担支配状态的注意力。

Nobody ever gets it wrong.

没有人会弄错。

You no longer have to imagine a world where you can spell-cast another person to feel confident enough in your authority to surrender completely. Or one in which you are so well held, so cared for, so comfortable in the assured clasp of someone else's energetic authority that your animal body can relax entirely, allowing for true renewal.

你不再需要想象一个世界，在那里你可以用咒语影响另一个人，让你在自己的权威中感到足够的自信来完全投降。或者一个你被如此好地固定、如此被照顾、在别人能量权威的确定紧握中如此舒适的世界，以至于你的动物身体可以完全放松，允许真正的更新。

The flow of our attention, which is really the flow of our life force, is the most precious currency we have, and yet we live in a world that profits every time it is scattered. The economy runs on it. Learn to skillfully shepherd that currency, and it will begin to feel like you're working with magic.

我们注意力的流动，这真的是我们生命力的流动，是我们拥有的最珍贵的货币，然而我们生活在一个每次它被分散时都会从中获利的世界上。经济靠它运行。学会巧妙地引导这种货币，它就会开始感觉像你在使用魔法工作。

It's not magic; it's attention.

这不是魔法；这是注意力。
