#### Joining or Starting a Mistress Group | 加入或创建女主人小组
Academy graduates run Mistress groups in cities around the world. Our website, www.weteachpower.com, has lists of Mistress groups that are accepting new Mistresses in your area.

学院毕业生在世界各地的城市运营女主人小组。我们的网站 www.weteachpower.com 上有你所在地区接受新女主人加入的小组名单。

If you want to set up your own, register on our website to receive bonus assignments, videos, and exercises. You can choose to make your group open to welcoming new Mistresses, keep it completely private, or do it in your own way.

如果你想建立自己的小组，请在我们的网站上注册，以接收额外的作业、视频和练习。你可以选择让你的小组开放欢迎新的女主人，完全保持私密，或者按你自己的方式运作。

What's important to me is that women share these tools with their communities, adapt them, and use them to change the world around them.

对我来说重要的是，女性与她们的社区分享这些工具，适应它们，并用它们来改变她们周围的世界。

Here are some best practices.

以下是一些最佳实践。
#### WHO? | 谁？

Your group may be as small as two people. For in-person groups, we find that four to eight people is an ideal number. For online groups, we've found that the ideal range is three to twelve women. More is cumbersome.

你的小组可以小到只有两个人。对于线下小组，我们发现四到八个人是理想的数字。对于线上小组，我们发现三到十二个女性是理想的范围。再多就变得笨拙了。

Find at least one or two women who agree to meet up. That can be more than enough—you can always invite others to join once you've gotten the ball rolling.

找到至少一两个同意聚会的女性。这可能就足够了——一旦你开始运作，你总是可以邀请其他人加入。

You can call your Mistress group whatever you want. (Our school boasts some pretty colorful group names.) If you choose to keep the word "Mistress" and anyone questions you, you can politely inform them that the word "mistress" is the only feminine form of the word "master" in the English language.

你可以随意称呼你的女主人小组。（我们学校有一些相当丰富多彩的小组名称。）如果你选择保留"Mistress"这个词，而有人质疑你，你可以礼貌地告诉他们，"mistress"是英语中"master"的唯一女性形式。

Some of the names the groups choose reflect their special focus: Mamma Dommes, Money Wielding Wonder Women, Mistresses of Justice (they're activism-centered), and the Mistress Mayhem Mischief Makers, who focused on the Bad Girl Protocol and having as much fun as they could—and who went on to found the Bad Girl Summer Camp.

一些小组选择的名称反映了她们的特殊关注点：妈妈女支配者、金钱挥舞的奇迹女性、正义女主人（她们以行动主义为中心），以及女主人混乱恶作剧制造者，她们专注于坏女孩准则（Bad Girl Protocol），尽可能多地享受乐趣——她们后来创办了坏女孩夏令营。
#### HOW DO I ASK PEOPLE TO JOIN? | 如何邀请人们加入？

**DOMME:** Hey! You're one of my favorite women! Do you want to join me and a few other women for an evening to create a secret society that will take over the world? I'm hosting a Mistress group!

**女支配者：** 嘿！你是我最喜欢的女性之一！你想和我以及其他几个女性一起度过一个晚上，创建一个将统治世界的秘密社团吗？我正在主持一个女主人小组！

**SUB:** Hey! I have an amazing idea! I have a dream of getting the best women I know to acquire the skills necessary to take over the world! I imagine us getting together and plotting world domination. I'd love it if you were one of those women! Will you join us?

**被支配者：** 嘿！我有一个很棒的想法！我梦想让我认识的最优秀的女性获得统治世界所需的技能！我想象我们一起聚会，策划世界统治。如果你是那些女性中的一员，我会很高兴！你愿意加入我们吗？

#### WHEN? | 什么时候？

If you're doing an online group via Skype or Zoom, we find that one hour is usually perfect; for in-person meetings, one to two and a half hours.

如果你通过 Skype 或 Zoom 进行线上小组，我们发现一小时通常是最完美的；对于线下会议，一到两个半小时。
#### WHERE? | 在哪里？

We recommend your first gathering be somewhere quiet and private. Subsequent meetings can take place in parks, bars, or dungeons! Communities and groups have a way of evolving naturally. For the first one, however, a member's living room might make the most sense.

我们建议你的第一次聚会选择安静私密的地方。后续的会议可以在公园、酒吧或地牢里举行！社区和小组有自然发展的方式。然而，对于第一次聚会，某个成员的客厅可能是最合适的选择。

#### HOW? | 怎么做？

Here's a general protocol for Mistress groups.

以下是女主人小组的一般协议。

#### CHECK-INS | 签到
"Right now I'm feeling ___________ ."

"现在我感觉___________。"

Go around the room, one by one. Everyone answers the following prompt:

在房间里轮流进行，一个接一个。每个人都回答以下提示：

"My name is ___________, and right now, I'm feeling ___________."

"我的名字是___________，现在我感觉___________。"

Single word answers are encouraged.

鼓励使用单词回答。

"The thing I'm thinking about a lot this week is ___________ ."

"这周我经常想的一件事是___________。"
Once again, everyone answers the following prompt:

再次，每个人都回答以下提示：

"The thing I'm thinking about a lot this week is _____________ ."

"这周我经常想的一件事是_____________。"

Two minutes per person is usually a good amount of time. At the end of the two minutes, the organizer thanks them.

每人两分钟通常是一个合适的时间。在两分钟结束时，组织者感谢她们。

No coaching or feedback.

不提供指导或反馈。

In subsequent meetings of your group, you can change the prompt. For prompt examples, check out our website.

在你小组的后续会议中，你可以更改提示。有关提示示例，请查看我们的网站。
#### Partnered Exercises | 配对练习

These exercises work well done in pairs: Things Unsaid, Bad Girl Protocol, Asking Practice.

这些练习适合两人配对进行：未曾言说之事（Things Unsaid）、坏女孩准则（Bad Girl Protocol）、要求练习（Asking Practice）。

(See Things Unsaid on \h  for an example of how an exercise might work in partnership.) For worksheets with instructions for the other exercises (and additional ones not covered in the book), check out our website.

（参见第\h页的未曾言说之事，了解练习如何在合作中进行的示例。）有关其他练习（以及书中未涵盖的额外练习）的说明工作表，请查看我们的网站。

Have everyone pair off. If choosing who starts first is awkward, come up with a universal rule, like "The person with the longest hair goes first!"

让每个人都配对。如果选择谁先开始很尴尬，可以制定一个通用规则，比如"头发最长的人先开始！"

#### General Rules for Partnered Exercises | 配对练习的一般规则
Both partners have to take a turn.

两个伙伴都必须轮流进行。

Choose a time limit (anywhere from five to fifteen minutes per person, for example).

选择时间限制（例如，每人五到十五分钟）。

One person keeps time and lets the other person know when they have thirty seconds left.

一个人计时，并在对方还剩三十秒时告知她们。

No coaching or feedback other than what the scripts provide.

除了脚本提供的内容外，不提供指导或反馈。

When time runs out, the person who was holding space reflects a frame. "I frame the moment when you . . ."

时间到了，那个保持空间的人会反映一个框架。"我框定你……的时刻。"
#### Frames | 框架

This exercise, which you may already be familiar with from other systems, is an offering: everyone shares the moment that made them feel most alive. They share these descriptions without intellectual analysis or stories about their own experiences and past.

这个练习，你可能已经从其他系统中熟悉了，是一个奉献：每个人都分享让她们感觉最有活力的时刻。她们分享这些描述，不进行智力分析或讲述她们自己的经历和过去。

### Frames are confined to a moment in time, and felt in the body.

### 框架局限于时间中的一个时刻，并在身体中感受。

For the person who is being framed, frames are a way to anchor what she felt. For the people doing the framing, it's a way of educating yourself, of imprinting what you've seen on your own psyche, of deciding what you want to keep.

对于被框定的人，框架是锚定她所感受的一种方式。对于进行框定的人，这是教育自己、将所见印刻在自己心灵上、决定要保留什么的一种方式。

Some examples, from Mistress Alia's pirate party:

一些例子，来自女主人阿莉娅的海盗派对：
"I frame all of us running down a dark suburban street; I haven't felt that free—that bad—since high school."

"我框定我们所有人跑下黑暗的郊区街道；自从高中以来，我从未感到如此自由——如此叛逆。"

"I frame the moment you said 'I always hated my mother-in-law,' and let a piece of her wedding china drop to the floor."

"我框定你说'我一直讨厌我的婆婆'的时刻，让她的结婚瓷器掉到地板上。"

"I frame sitting on the couch at Kim's, seeing our pirate captain make ruthless decisions about her past and how she was going to create a new future."

"我框定坐在金姆家的沙发上，看到我们的海盗船长对她的过去做出无情的决定，以及她将如何创造新的未来。"

"I frame the moment we couldn't stop laughing after we discovered we'd accidentally stolen one of your ex's shoes."

"我框定我们发现意外偷了你前任的一只鞋后无法停止大笑的时刻。"

And a frame from Alia to myself: "I frame that this thing I dreaded turned out to be more fun than my bachelorette party. And my wedding. And I frame realizing how unattached I am to all of this crap."

阿莉娅给我的一个框架："我框定我害怕的这件事结果比我的单身派对更有趣。还有我的婚礼。我框定意识到我对所有这些废话是多么不执着。"
Another way to do this is to say what you thought was hot. "I thought it was really hot when you said . . ."

另一种做法是说出你认为很性感的事情。"当你说……时，我认为真的很性感。"

In class, we use frames all the time—to start a session, to end one, and to cap every exercise. The person doing the exercise is the only one who doesn't get to see it. And because so much happens in class, it's helpful for everyone else to be able to take a mental snapshot of the moments that had the greatest effect on them.

在课堂上，我们一直使用框架——开始一个环节，结束一个环节，并为每个练习做总结。做练习的人是唯一看不到它的人。因为在课堂上发生了这么多事情，对其他人来说，能够对她们影响最大的时刻进行心理快照是很有帮助的。

"When you said that you wanted to keep the baby, your spine straightened." "It was a whisper, but we could hear it throughout the whole room." "I was moved to tears by the way you told him you wanted to keep the baby; I'm crying just thinking about the way you said that."

"当你说你想保留孩子时，你的脊柱挺直了。""那是一个耳语，但我们能在整个房间里听到。""我被你告诉他你想保留孩子的方式感动得流泪；我只是想到你说那句话的方式就在哭泣。"

When we frame moments of vitality, and learn to reflect what's radiant and alive, we bypass social conditioning and strengthen our own recognition of the living impulse. It encourages you to ask: What was alive about what I just saw? What was true? What needs watering? What wants to grow?

当我们框定活力的时刻，学会反映什么是光芒四射和充满活力的，我们绕过了社会条件反射，加强了自己对生命冲动的认识。它鼓励你问：我刚才看到的什么是活着的？什么是真实的？什么需要浇灌？什么想要成长？

Framing a moment is basically the same technique as a high-quality self-celebration—specific, grounded in a moment in time, and body-based, not intellectual. Which moments do you want to keep? What do you want to celebrate?

框定一个时刻基本上与高质量的自我庆祝是相同的技巧——具体的，基于时间中的一个时刻，以身体为基础，而不是智力的。你想保留哪些时刻？你想庆祝什么？
Avoid getting abstract with your frames or providing interpretations. The more concentrated, the better.

避免在你的框架中变得抽象或提供解释。越集中越好。
