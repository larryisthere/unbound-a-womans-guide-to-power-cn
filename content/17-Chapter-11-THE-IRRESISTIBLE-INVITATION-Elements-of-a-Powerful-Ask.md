# Chapter 11: THE IRRESISTIBLE INVITATION | 不可抗拒的邀请 

## Elements of a Powerful Ask | 强有力的要求的要素

Whether you're asking your partner to agree to pull the kids out of school to have a Swiss Family Robinson–type adventure, for your brother to share the responsibility of your parents' elder care, or for your sweet husband to try a bodice-ripping role play on your next date night—it's time to Ask.

无论你是要求你的伴侣同意让孩子们离开学校，进行一次《海角一乐园》式的冒险，还是要求你的兄弟分担你父母的养老责任，或者要求你可爱的丈夫在你们的下一个约会之夜尝试充满激情的角色扮演——是时候开口了。

You know what you want, and you've worked through a lot of the feelings you have about asking for it. You know why to ask, and you're inoculated against no. In this chapter, we get to the how.

你知道自己想要什么，也已经体会了很多关于提出要求的感受。你明白为什么要提出要求，并且已经做好了被拒绝的准备。在这一章中，我们将讨论具体要怎么做。

Of course, the most important component will be where your attention is focused. But directing your attention successfully will be easier if you have seen to some of these other elements.

当然，这当中最重要的是你的注意力集中在哪里。而如果你已经考虑到这些因素，你的注意力将会更容易被引导。

Remember: You have no say in what you want, and nothing is more compelling than the true burning desire that shines through your Ask.

记住：你无法决定是否能得到你想要的东西，而最能帮你得到它的，就是闪耀着强烈的渴望的要求。

#### Refining Your Ask: Get Specific | 完善你的要求：具体化

Go back to your Asking Practice; it's time to get granular.

回到你的"要求练习"中去；现在是时候进入细节了。

Specificity is essential when you're formulating your Book of Desires, and it's important when you're celebrating your wins. For all the same reasons, it's also (even more!) important when you're making an Ask.

当你制定你的《渴望之书》时，一定要具体，当你庆祝你的胜利时，它很重要。当你提出要求时，它同样很重要（甚至更重要！）。

When I look at a new student's Asking Practice, I often see a lot of vague, intangible requests, what I call "impossible requests destined for failure," like: "I want you to mentor me," "Be more romantic," or "Show me more respect."

当我观察一个新学生的要求练习时，我经常看到很多模糊的、抽象的要求，我称之为"注定要失败的不可能的要求"，比如："我希望你能指导我"，"更加浪漫"，或"对我更加尊重"。

Those are completely worthwhile desires! But they're not (yet) Asks, and this is important.

这些都是完全合理的渴望！但它们还不能算是"要求"，注意到这点很重要。

First of all, we want you to get what you want, the way you want it. "But he should just know," women tell me, even as they're throwing resentment his way because he doesn't have the slightest idea what she means by "romance" or "respect." What these women are really saying is: "Figure out how to make me feel loved, esteemed, and admired." This simply isn't fair. How can our partners, classmates, and friends know what symbolic weight we've attached to our desires, when we're so wildly and wonderfully varied in what we want?

首先，我们希望你能得到你想要的东西，以你想要的方式。"但他应该知道，"女人们总是这样告诉我，即使她们对他心生怨恨，因为他根本不知道她所说的"浪漫"或"尊重"是什么意思。这些女人们真正想说的是："想办法让我感到被爱、被尊重、被钦佩。"这根本不公平。我们的伴侣、同学和朋友怎么能知道我们的渴望背后的象征意义，而我们每个人的需求又是如此不同？

Let's look at this in the workplace.

让我们来看看职场中的情况。

Over cocktails after work, four women might say they have the same desire—"to have my talent and efforts recognized and rewarded." But when they actually drill down on what will satisfy their individual desires, we find four radically different impulses.

下班后喝着鸡尾酒，四个女人可能会说她们有同样的渴望——"让我的才能和努力得到认可和回报"。但当她们真正深入了解什么能满足她们各自的渴望时，我们发现了四种完全不同的冲动。

Miki wants her diligence acknowledged with a raise, because money is the symbol that matters most to her, whereas Jane would feel most rewarded by a more flexible, independently determined schedule. Tasha, in the next office over, wants a shinier title and the bump in prestige that would come from a move up the corporate ladder, whereas Sari's whole body lights up when she talks about presenting her work at the annual conference in Beijing.

三木希望她的勤奋能换来加薪，因为金钱是对她来说最重要的象征，而简则希望得到的回报是更灵活的、更自主的时间表。在隔壁办公室的塔莎想要一个更闪亮的头衔，以及晋升后声望的提升，而莎莉在谈到在北京的年会上介绍她的工作时，整个身体都亮了起来。

How will they make those desires explicit? With specific Asks. If Sari never tells her boss about her conference ambition, then her boss can't be faulted for rewarding her by giving her a raise. Everyone wants more money, right? And of course Sari will accept that bigger paycheck, even though it's not what she really wants. But if Sari asks—if she speaks up about her Beijing conference dreams (and please notice how specific this Ask is; not: "I'd like to travel more")—then everybody gets the chance to start winning really big. Sari will get what she really wants, and her boss will feel the satisfaction of making her star employee really happy. And doesn't the company benefit from brilliant Sari taking her research into an international forum?

她们将如何明确表达这些渴望？通过具体的要求。如果莎莉从不告诉她的老板她对那会议的野心，那么她的老板给她加薪作为奖励是无可厚非的。每个人都想要更多的钱，对吧？当然，莎莉会接受更高的薪水，即使这不是她真正想要的。但如果莎莉提出要求——如果她说出她参加北京会议的梦想（请注意这个要求有多具体；而不是："我想要更多旅行"）——那么每个人都有机会开始真正取得巨大成功。莎莉会得到她真正想要的东西，而她的老板也会因为让她的明星员工真正开心而感到满足。而且，公司难道不会因为聪明的萨莉把她的研究带到国际会议上而受益吗？

It's deeply unfair to make the people you are in relationships with guess what has the most symbolic weight for you—especially when even the people who know us best can easily get it wrong.

让与你有关系的人猜测什么对你最有象征意义，这是很不公平的——尤其是当最了解我们的人也很容易判断错误的时候。

"I want to do something special for my fortieth," you tell your best friend—so she plans a surprise where a hundred far-flung acquaintances ambush you at a bar. That sure is special; it's also the opposite of what you had in mind. What you really wanted this year was for the three women you love most in the world to join you at a cabin in the middle of nowhere for a weekend of swimming and hiking and cooking and talking long into the night. In all likelihood, all you had to do to get exactly what you wanted was to make a specific Ask.

"我想为我的四十岁做一些特别的事情，"你告诉你最好的朋友，于是她计划给你一个惊喜，让一百个远方的熟人忽然出现在酒吧中。这当然很特别；但这也与你的想法相反。你今年真正想要的是和你最爱的三个女人一起在荒郊野外的小木屋里度过一个周末，一起游泳、徒步旅行、做饭和彻夜长谈。很有可能，你所需要做的只是提出一个具体的要求，这样才能得到你真正想要的东西。

In classes, I ask my students: "What would it look like if you had more time together, more romance, more authority?" What does more independence at work mean, or a better sex life? Because we can keep asking for intangibles like "respect" and "closure"—but all it ever seems to yield is dumber men and angrier women.

在课堂上，我问学生："如果给你们更多的相处时间，更多的浪漫，更大的自由度，会是什么样子？"工作上更独立意味着什么，或者更好的性生活意味着什么？因为我们可以不断要求"尊重"和"舒服的收尾"等抽象的东西——但它似乎只会带来更愚蠢的男人和更愤怒的女人。

If Asking has the potential to create new roles for the people in your life, then these Impossible Asks create the conditions for failure by setting them up to disappoint you. If you tell your dad, "I want to feel like you care about me," all he's going to hear is: "You failed me as a father, and there's nothing you can do." Again: ask five of your friends, and you'll get five different answers to describe a fantastic father-daughter relationship. So how is your dad to know what you want?

如果"要求"有可能为你身边的人创造新的角色，那么那些注定会失败的"不可能的要求"就会给你带来失望。如果你告诉你爸爸，"我想感受到你对我的关心"，他只会听到："你作为父亲让我失望了，而且你什么也做不了。"再说一次：问你的五个朋友，他们会给出五种不同的美好父女关系的描述。那么你爸爸怎么会知道你真正想要的是什么呢？

But everything changes as soon as you say, "Dad, will you send me a text every Monday morning, telling me you hope I have a great week?"

但是当你说出"爸爸，你能每周一早上给我发短信，告诉我你希望我度过愉快的一周吗？"的时候，一切都变了。

There's another, more selfish reason to get specific. If you don't set very clear parameters, then how will you know whether the Ask you came up with satisfied the desire it was designed to address?

还有一个更自私的让你具体化的理由。如果你不设定非常明确的标准，那么你怎么知道你提出的要求是否满足了它背后所指向的渴望呢？

Let's say you identify a desire to feel more connected to your lover after a long spell of working too much. "I just want to spend more time together," you hear yourself saying. But that request isn't explicit enough; it's a science experiment! Do you know exactly how much time you're currently spending together? How many more minutes or hours a week do you want? Can the time spent be doing anything at all, or is it "quality" time—yet another intangible—you're after?

假设你在长时间工作后，发现自己想和爱人更加亲密。"我只是想花更多时间在一起，"你听到自己说。但这个要求还不够明确；这是一个科学实验！你知道你们现在在一起待了多少时间吗？你每周想多待几分钟或几个小时？这些时间随便做什么都行，还是你在追求"有品质"的时光——另一个抽象的概念？

With this Impossible Ask, you've created a situation where your lover is very likely confused, and will almost certainly fail to deliver. He can't read your mind! Tell him exactly what to do and how to do it, and how long to do it for, though, and the lines are clearly drawn. Very often, you'll find that a specific request, delivered congruently, will come as a tremendous relief to the men in your life.

有了这个"不可能的要求"，你就已经将你的爱人置于可能很困惑并且几乎肯定无法满足要求的境地。他无法了解你的想法！不过，告诉他该做什么，怎么做，做多久，界限就很清楚了。很多时候，你会发现，一个具体的要求，以一致的方式表达，会让你生活中的男人感到极大的宽慰。

The other problem with an Impossible Ask is that it's also impossible for you to know whether the Ask you've come up with is adequately addressing your desire. Please don't take the importance of this for granted: We are mysteries unto ourselves. It happens all the time that an experience doesn't hit the spot—no matter how closely it matches a fantasy or an idea we had. It is only through the lived experience that we move closer to what we want and who we want to be.

"不可能的要求"的另一个问题是，你也不可能知道你想出的要求是否充分满足了你的渴望。请不要认为这一点是理所当然的：我们对自己来说是个谜。经验是无法命中要害的——无论它与我们的幻想或想法有多么接近。只有通过亲身体验，我们才能更接近我们想要的东西和我们想要成为的人。

Every Ask is really an experiment, and to complete the experiment, you have to ask yourself, "How did that feel?"

每一次要求其实都是一次实验，为了完成实验，你必须问自己，"那是什么感觉？"

Let's say Ruby asks her boyfriend for more "quality time," a classic Impossible Ask. Her boyfriend—utterly befuddled by the request—takes a stab at pleasing her by suggesting they go to the movies. She appreciates his effort and therefore glosses over the fact that her actual desire, which was to be seen and heard, and to see and hear her partner, was completely unmet by the two hours they spent eating popcorn in the dark. She never got the feeling she wanted—but she may not even allow herself to recognize this because it would seem "ungrateful."

假设露比要求她的男朋友提供更多的"有品质的时间"，这是一个典型的"不可能的要求"。她的男友对这个要求完全感到困惑，于是试图通过建议一起去看电影来取悦她。她感谢他的努力，并因此掩盖了她的真实渴望，即被看到和听到，以及看到和听到她的伴侣。这在他们在黑暗中吃爆米花的两个小时里，完全没有被满足。她从来没有得到她想要的感觉——但她可能甚至不允许自己承认这一点，因为这显得"不知感恩"。

Maybe going to the movies didn't really work. And when she refined her Ask—"Can we go out for dinner and talk about our summer plans?"—that didn't scratch the itch either. But the half-hour the two of them spent, reading silently together on the couch, feet entangled and the cat between them? She can't stop thinking about that. So it's time to go sub, to isolate what she liked so much about that—and then come up with an Ask that will give her that feeling again.

也许去看电影并没有起到什么作用。而当她改进了她的要求——"我们能不能出去吃晚饭，谈谈我们的夏季计划？"——那也没有满足她的需求。那他们两个一起在沙发上默默地读书，脚搭在一起，中间还趴着一只猫的半个小时呢？她无法停止思考这些。因此，现在是时候了，要把她喜欢的东西分离出来，然后想出一个能再次给她带来这种感觉的"要求"。

Getting what we don't want—recognizing that, and changing course—is a huge part of living a desire-driven life! But it can't work if we get something close and don't allow ourselves to feel what's really true: that what we got didn't hit the spot.

也许得到的不是我们真正想要的东西，意识到这一点然后改变方向，是过上由渴望驱动的生活的重要部分！但如果我们得到的东西只是接近我们想要的，却不是真正的目标，而我们又不愿意承认这一点，那这条路是行不通的。

This is why we call an intangible Ask an Impossible Ask. It doesn't provide the giver the information they'd need to succeed, or even to get close. And it doesn't give the receiver the information they'd need to know whether the desire was satisfied. Not to mention that it doesn't allow the giver the satisfaction of knowing that what they gave hit the spot, and the receiver the satisfaction of getting it exactly how she wants it.

这就是为什么我们称抽象的要求为"不可能的要求"。它不会为给予者提供成功所需的信息，甚至不会提供接近成功所需的信息。它也不会为接受者提供他们需要的信息，让他们知道渴望是否得到满足。更不用说，它不会让给予者因为知道给出的东西击中了要害而感到满意，也不会让接受者因为得到了她们想要的东西而感到满意。

We are constantly discovering ourselves and each other. One of the best ways to do this is by constantly refining our desires and changing course.

我们不断地探索自我和彼此。实现这一点的最好方法之一就是不断完善我们的渴望并改变方向。

If you say, "I would love to spend an hour with you on Tuesday where all you do is listen to me yell at you, and then at the end of that I'd like you to thank me and then fuck me," then your lover knows exactly what you want them to do.

如果你说："我很想在星期二和你呆上一个小时，你所要做的就是听我对你大喊大叫，然后在那之后我希望你能对我谢谢，然后干我。"那么你的爱人就确切地知道你希望他们做什么。

You will also know exactly whether it happened or not. It's too easy for someone to say yes to a vague request, then fail to follow through. Sure, they'd be happy to "be more affectionate." But if you say, "Will you agree to shut off all electronics while we cuddle and watch a movie together on Tuesday night?" then you know right away whether it happened—and if not, you'll get some very clear information about where the resistance lies.

你也会清楚地知道它是否发生了。人们很容易对一个模糊的要求说"是"，然后又不去执行。当然，他们会很乐意"更亲近"。但如果你说，"你同意在周二晚上我们依偎在一起看电影时关掉所有电子设备吗？"那么你马上就知道是否发生了——如果没有，你会得到一些非常明确的信息，了解阻力在哪里。

Best of all, once you've gotten your electronics-free movie and cuddle, you'll know whether the Ask you came up with satisfied the desire that gave rise to it in the first place. Did it work? Do you feel more connected? If you don't, then you can try another (specific) request, and see if that moves the game forward.

最棒的是，一旦你得到了没有电子设备的电影和拥抱，你就会知道你提出的要求是否满足了最初产生这个要求的渴望。它起作用了吗？你感觉更亲密了吗？如果没有，那么你可以尝试另一个（具体）要求，看看这是否能推动游戏向前发展。

And what if your lover doesn't show up? Or tells you they're not interested in your Tuesday plan?

如果你的爱人没有出现，或者告诉你他们对你周二的计划不感兴趣，又该如何？

That simply means that you've encountered some resistance—and Academy students know that's when the real fun starts. You can play there, renegotiate, come up with a solution that's better than the one that you (or they!) initially proposed. We will talk at much greater length about how to turn resistance into an amazing opportunity for intimacy in chapters to come. For now, just know: A specific Ask is an essential first step.

这仅仅意味着你遇到了一些阻力——我学校的学生们知道，真正的乐趣就从那时开始。你可以在那里玩耍，重新商量，想出一个比你（或他们！）最初提出的更好的解决方案。在接下来的章节中，我们将更详细地讨论如何将阻力转化为建立亲密关系的绝佳机会。现在，只需知道：一个具体的要求是必不可少的第一步。

If you're feeling irritated or frustrated by the idea of adding another item to your invisible labor to-do list: I get it. I understand that women want men to know without telling them.

如果你因为在隐形劳动待办事项清单上再添加一项而感到恼火或沮丧：我理解。我明白女人希望男人知道却不告诉他们。

But I will say two things. First, the bulk of the work isn't coming up with specifics to ask for—it's getting in touch with our own desires enough to do so. This is a valuable process in itself, and work that will ultimately profit you. Because once you know it and feel it and own it and feel legitimate about it, the Ask either has happened by itself or is going to be very easy to speak.

但我要说两点。首先，大部分工作不是提出具体要求，而是充分了解我们自己的渴望。这本身就是一个有价值的过程，最终会让你受益。因为一旦你知道它、感受它、拥有它并觉得它是合理的，那么这个要求要么已经自然而然地发生了，要么也会很容易说出口。

And there's still plenty of opportunity for them to surprise you, too. Once you have successfully introduced the people in your life to the landscape of your desires, once you have taught them the unique language of your pleasure and satisfaction and happiness through your Asks, then they will start to improvise.

另外，他们也有机会带给你很多惊喜。一旦你成功地向你身边的人描绘出你的渴望，一旦你通过你的要求教会了他们你快乐、满足和幸福的独特语言，他们就会开始即兴发挥。

Once your girlfriend understands that roses don't work as a romantic gesture but hair-pulling and dirty talk really does, then she's going to have a lot to play with when Valentine's Day rolls around. When your sister understands that you'd rather spend time with her than add another scented candle to your collection, she has the chance to surprise you with an experience—a trapeze class!—that you didn't even know you wanted. Once Sari's boss begins to understand what lights Sari up and why, he's going to start asking how else she can invigorate her research by cross-pollinating her ideas with other top-level experts in her field. Chances are, he knows about openings Sari doesn't.

一旦你的女朋友明白了玫瑰花不是一种浪漫的表达，而拉头发和污言秽语却真的有效，那么情人节到来时，她就有很多可以发挥的空间了。当你的妹妹明白你更愿花时间和她在一起，而不是再添一支香薰蜡烛到你的收藏中时，她就有机会给你一个惊喜——比如一个你甚至不知道自己想要的空中飞人课！一旦莎莉的老板开始明白是什么让莎莉兴奋不已，他就会开始询问还有什么其他方法可以通过与领域内其他顶尖专家的交叉交流来激发她的研究。很有可能，他知道莎莉不知道的窍门。

By asking, Sari has expanded her boss's role and invited him to collaborate in her satisfaction, so that instead of "Why isn't she happier with her raise?" the question becomes, "Why stop at Beijing?"

通过要求，莎莉扩大了老板的边界，并邀请他在她满意这件事上合作，这样一来，问题就不再是"为什么她对加薪不满意？"，而是"为什么止步于北京？"

But we're getting ahead of ourselves—this chapter is about the how. So how should Sari make her Ask?

但我们有些操之过急了——这一章是关于具体的做法。那么莎莉该如何提出要求呢？

She's already done some of the exercises in this book. She knows what she's angry about, what she's not talking about, and has started to close in on a few deep-seated desires, like the trip to Beijing. She's celebrated some wins with her Mistress group. She's starting to understand the power Asking has to transform relationships, and has gathered a few clues about why what she's been doing hasn't been working so well. The Ask she made of her kids this morning was very specific—instead of screaming, "We're leaving in five minutes! Get ready for school!" she put her attention out on them and said, "Put your lunch and your homework folder in your backpack first, then get your shoes on," and it worked.

她已经做了一些书中的练习。她知道自己为什么生气，知道自己没说出口的是什么，并且开始接近一些深层次的渴望，比如去北京旅行。她和她的女主人小组庆祝了一些胜利。她开始理解提出要求改变关系的力量，并且已经找到了为什么以前的做法效果不佳的一些线索。她今天早上对孩子们提出的要求非常具体——她没有大喊"我们五分钟后出发！准备上学！"而是把注意力放在孩子们身上，说："先把午餐和作业夹放进书包，然后穿上鞋子。"结果很奏效。

What's next? How does she take what she's learned and walk into her boss's office and tell him that she wants to present at the conference in Beijing?

接下来呢？她该如何利用所学的知识，走进老板的办公室，告诉他她想在北京的会议上做演讲呢？

First, Sari has to turn her attention inward and connect to her desire. Then she does the Legitimacy exercise. She really goes there—she feels the giddy excitement and delicious sense of adventure she will have reviewing her PowerPoint as an Air China flight attendant offers her a drink. She feels pride in her chest as she picks up her badge at the conference center, her name above her company's name. She traces the Chinese characters with her finger, imagines sending a picture of the badge to her Mistress group's Victory Log thread.

首先，莎莉需要将注意力转向内心，连接自己的渴望。然后，她要进行正当性练习。她真的做到了——她感受到那种兴奋和冒险的美妙感觉，想象着在中国国际航空的航班上，一名空乘人员递给她饮料时，她正在审阅PPT的样子。当她在会议中心领取徽章时，她看到自己的名字出现在公司名称之上，她感到胸中充满了自豪。她用手指描摹着汉字，想象着自己把徽章的照片发送到她的女主人小组的"胜利日志"主题下的样子。

She envisions everything this trip will make possible for her—the international contacts she'll be able to reach out to in the future, the knowledge and perspective she'll return with, the way she'll carry herself in her new role as the company's representative in Asia, and then the rest of the world.

她设想了这次旅行将为她带来的所有可能——未来能够建立的国际联系，带回来的知识和视角，以及她以公司驻亚洲乃至全球代表的新角色展现自我时的表现。

That legitimacy will help when she goes to make her Ask. It will also make her more legible to her boss, who will be able to see—and feel!—that she is not only ready for this new role but already occupying it. The physical sensations will train her body in the win, the emotional connection will help her to transmit her desire, and the mental stage will not only inspire her but help her build her case.

这种正当性将有助于她提出要求。这也会让她的老板更容易理解她，并且感受到她不仅已经准备好担任这个新角色，而且已经在扮演这个角色了。身体的感觉会训练她的身体去适应胜利，情感上的连接会帮助她表达自己的渴望，而心理上的准备不仅会激励她，还会帮助她更好地陈述自己的理由。

This is why we do the Legitimacy cycle three times, each time adding language and sensation to the landscape of the Ask.

这就是为什么我们要进行三次正当性循环，每次都为要求的情境添加语言和感官体验。

Then she will do a version for her boss, addressing his mental, emotional, and physical concerns—the positive, and the negative. How will his landscape change with what she's proposing? What will her Ask cost him, and the company? What value will it add?

然后，其中一个版本专门面向她的老板，解决他心理、情感和身体上的顾虑——积极的和消极的。她的提议会如何改变他的愿景？她的要求会给他和公司带来什么成本？又会增加什么价值？

She might want to role-play the Ask with her Mistress group. How would she make this request from the deeply connected, inward focus of the submissive, or the attention-out agency of the domme?

她可能想和她的女主人小组一起通过角色扮演的方式练习要求。她会如何从深度连接、向内关注的被支配者角度，或者从向外关注的支配者角度提出这个要求？

A submissive Ask might be a very good way for Sari to present this idea to her boss—drawing her boss into the inner world of her wants and needs. "I'm on fire about bringing what we do here to an international audience," she might say, speaking from her heart. "I was born to do this, and I know that the strength of my passion will translate into incredible opportunities for us. I want to go out there and deliver our vision in a groundbreaking way. Will you back me?"

被支配者的要求可能是莎莉向她的老板呈现这个想法的一个非常好的方式——将她的老板引入她内心需求和渴望的世界。她可能会发自内心地说："我热切地想要把我们在这里所做的事情带给国际观众。我天生就适合做这件事，我知道我热情的力量将为我们带来难以置信的机会。我想以一种开创性的方式传递我们的愿景。你会支持我吗？"

Can you feel how compelling Sari's connection is to this desire—and to the Ask that it gave rise to? Can you feel how much power there is in this type of legitimacy? Can you see how this kind of Ask will fundamentally change Sari's relationship with her boss—how it expands what he knows about her, and how he can imagine himself playing an expanded role in her career? There's nothing weak about an Ask like this—just a compelling sense of connection, so in this case, a submissive Ask might be a very good choice.

你能感受到莎莉与这种渴望以及由此引发的要求之间的联系有多么紧密吗？你能感受到这种正当性中有多大的力量吗？你能看到这种要求将如何从根本上改变莎莉与她老板的关系吗——它如何增加了他对她的了解，并让他能够想象自己在她的职业生涯中扮演更重要的角色吗？这样的要求没有任何软弱之处——只有一种强烈的连接感，所以在这种情况下，被支配者的要求可能是一个非常好的选择。

Or Sari might decide to ask using a more dominant state of attention. (And no: There is no magic formula for how you decide. You will feel it in the moment—one state will feel more alive. And if one thing doesn't work, you will try another.)

或者，莎莉可能决定以更具支配性的状态来提出要求。（不，没有帮助做决定的魔法公式。你会在当下感受到它——一种会让你感觉更有活力的状态。如果这种方法不起作用，继续尝试另一种。）

How would her dominant request sound? She will put her attention out, onto her boss: "You have a rare gift for nurturing talent, and you create an environment where people are inspired to pursue excellence. You have a vision for this company, and for our global expansion—would you be my sponsor as I bring that vision to the annual conference in Beijing?"

她的支配性要求会是什么样的呢？她会把注意力放在她的老板身上："你在培养人才方面天赋异禀，并创造了一个激励人们追求卓越的环境。你对这家公司和我们的全球扩张有远见——你愿意成为我的赞助人，让我在北京的年会上实现这个愿景吗？"

Nice! But this presumes that Sari's boss is a good guy, inclined to give her this chance. What if she goes into the meeting knowing he's leaning toward no? She would almost certainly want to do a few boss-specific rounds of Things Unsaid. "I never told you that your temper creates an unsafe workspace and quashes the creativity and motivation of the people who work for you." And: "I never told you that I think I could do your job, only much better and with less drama."

很好！但这假设莎莉的老板是个好人，原意给她这个机会。可如果她在会议开始时知道他倾向于拒绝呢？她几乎肯定会想说一些老板的"未曾言说之事"。"我从未告诉过你，你的脾气创造了一个不安全的工作环境，压制了为你工作的人们的创造力和积极性。"还有："我从未告诉过你，我认为我可以做你的工作，而且会做得更好，还会少一些戏剧性冲突。"

That list might be long, but once she's alchemized some of that rage, knowing that he's disinclined to say yes, she might role-play a more forceful dominant Ask: "You run this company like a military commander; this leads to exceptional efficiency. And like a military leader, you're known for taking bold but calculated risks. You want a global empire? Send me to Beijing, and I will own that conference for you. Make me your lieutenant in this."

这个清单可能很长，可一旦她平息了一些愤怒，接受他不愿意答应的事实，她可能会提出更有力的支配性要求："你像军事指挥官一样管理这家公司；这带来了卓越的效率。像军事领导人一样，你以大胆但有计划地冒险而闻名。你想要一个全球帝国吗？那么派我去北京，我会为你掌控那场会议。让我成为你的副手。"

We'll talk more in an upcoming chapter about preparing for a Difficult Ask, but this is a good start. And if Sari, role-playing this with her Mistress group, feels wobbly, or can't decide whether a dominant or a submissive Ask is the way to go?

我们将在后面的章节中讨论如何为困难的要求做准备，但当前是很好的开始。以及，莎莉是否在和她的女主人小组角色扮演时感到摇摆不定，或者无法决定是选择支配性还是被支配性的要求方式？

For that, we have an exercise called the "Three-Way Ask."

为此，我们有一个叫做"三方要求"的练习。

#### The Three-Way Ask | 三方要求

Let me take you by the hand and lead you to a room filled with flowers and lit only by candles, so you can watch a woman ask a male volunteer a high-stakes Ask.

让我牵着你的手，带你进入一个充满鲜花、只用蜡烛照明的房间，你可以看到一位女性在向一位男性志愿者提出一个高风险的要求。

Feel in your body what happens when she asks at first, her voice a little too friendly but also too aggressive—apologetic and demanding all at the same time. She's walking the tightrope of the Smush, and we hear the compression, the bracing, the holding back.

当她第一次提出要求时，感受一下你的身体会发生什么，她的声音有点太友好，但也太咄咄逼人——同时带着歉意和需求。她走在一条紧绷的钢丝上，我们可以听到紧缩、支撑和退缩的声音。

The problem is that we know this woman. We've spent time laughing with her and listening to her. We've heard her desires and seen her strengths, and we know that she is ferocious, passionate, and profound, a force to be reckoned with. But where is the person we have come to know? She's not in that chair.

问题在于我们了解这个女人。我们曾与她一起欢笑、倾听她的心声。我们听过她的渴望，见过她的力量，知道她是一个凶猛、充满激情且深邃的人，是一股难以忽视的力量。但我们认识的那个人在哪里？她不在那把椅子上。

Now watch how quickly we can help this woman clean up her energetics. By breaking the compression, we put her back in touch with herself.

现在看看我们如何快速帮助这个女人清理她的能量。通过打破紧缩，我们让她重新与自己连接起来。

One technique to create congruence is to dramatically exaggerate each of the states of attention in a play situation so you fully occupy both before you ask for real.

一个创造一致性的技巧是在游戏情境中戏剧性地夸大每一种注意力状态，以便你在真正提出要求之前能够完全占据这两种状态。

I ask the women I work with to tell me their worst fears about asking. "I'm going to feel like an evil, castrating bitch if I actually say what I'm thinking out loud," she might tell me. Or "I can't stand feeling like a pathetic, needy girl. I need to be able to handle this myself."

我要求和我一起工作的女性告诉我她们最害怕提出要求的原因。"如果我真的说出我心里想的，我会觉得自己像个邪恶的、阉割人的泼妇，"她可能会告诉我。或者"我不能忍受感觉自己像个可怜、需要帮助的小女孩。我需要能够自己处理这件事。"

Then I encourage her to enact those fears, in the most dramatic way possible. If she's afraid of appearing weak, we keep going until she's whining and begging and crawling on the ground. If she's concerned about cruelty, I (gently) goad her to go there: "Let's hear the worst thing you've got. Make him cry." After she has fully inhabited both of these states of attention, amplifying both to the point of absurdity, her next version of the request comes out really, really clean.

然后我鼓励她以最戏剧化的方式表现这些恐惧。如果她害怕显得软弱，我们会一直进行下去，直到她在地上哀嚎、乞求和爬行。如果她担心残忍，我会（温和地）激励她这样做："让我们听听你能说的最糟糕的话。让他哭。"在她完全占据这两种注意力状态，并将其夸大到荒谬的程度后，她的下一个要求就会变得非常、非常清晰。

This is the genius of energetics. There's juice tied up in roles we don't allow ourselves to occupy; giving yourself permission to go there unleashes all that power, so that you can use it. The version of yourself that you're so afraid of—the pitiful, pathetic whiner, the bratty, foot-stamping bitch—is already in your body anyway. By embodying these states and experiencing them fully, you pass through them so they don't sneak up and surprise you. After you've mapped the territory, you stop being afraid of falling off the edge. You get to control them, instead of letting them control you.

这就是能量学的妙处。我们不允许自己扮演某些角色，但这些角色中其实蕴藏着巨大的能量；一旦你允许自己进入这些角色，就能释放这些能量，为你所用。你害怕的那个自己——可怜的、爱抱怨的、任性的、跺脚的——其实已经存在于你的身体里。通过充分体验这些状态，你会穿越它们，这样它们就不会突然袭击你。当你熟悉了这些情绪，你就不再害怕失控。你可以掌控它们，而不是被它们掌控。

Exaggerating these states of attention in a practice scenario also lays bare what's really happening with the flow of attention. It takes a little while, and a lot of practice, for us to learn how to direct our attention effectively. The woman who is most worried about being too overbearing and invasive is almost always not going far enough out—some part of her attention is still turned inward, which will make the signal she transmits wobbly, the instruction less than completely clear. Conversely, the woman who is afraid of weakness is almost never really fully tuned in or connected to what she wants.

在练习场景中夸大这些注意力状态还揭示了注意力流动的真实情况。我们需要一些时间和大量的练习来学习如何有效地引导我们的注意力。最担心自己过于霸道和侵略性的女性几乎总是走得不够远——她的一部分注意力仍然是向内的，这会使她发出的信号不稳，指令也不完全清晰。相反，害怕软弱的女性则几乎从未真正完全适应或连接她想要的东西。

When you practice your Ask by performing the most overstated and embellished version of dominance or submission, as silly as it may feel, it will get your attention where it needs to be. I've seen it hundreds of times—after channeling Cruella de Vil for a few minutes, her riding crop shoved into the guy's chest, our domme will eventually whisper one or two words into the volunteer's ear, and the whole room will respond with an electric jolt. After all that overacting, she's finally out, her animal body communicating dominance to his.

当你通过表演最夸张、最华丽的支配或被支配来练习你的要求时，尽管可能感觉很傻，但它会让你的注意力集中在需要的地方。我见过成百上千次了——在模仿《101忠狗》中的库伊拉·德·威尔几分钟后，她的马鞭抵住男志愿者的胸口，我们的支配者最终会在志愿者耳边低语一两句话，整个房间都能感受到一阵电流。经过所有这些夸张的表演，她终于打开了，她那野兽般的身体向他传达着对他的支配。

注：库伊拉·德·威尔（英语：Cruella De Vil），又译为库伊拉·迪维尔，是1961年迪斯尼动画电影《101忠狗》中的反派角色之一。见：《维基百科》库伊拉·德·威尔词条

Similarly, when she role-plays submission, after she's crawled and wailed and begged, we'll finally see her connect with herself and her desire. Suddenly, she's asking like she already has what she's asking for. The histrionics die down, and with no attention out to confuse the signal, she'll become legible to us, as easy to read as a picture book.

同样地，当她角色扮演被支配者时，在她爬行、哀嚎和乞求之后，我们最终会看到她将自己和她的渴望连接。突然间，她开始提出要求，就好像她已经得到了她想要的东西一样。夸张的表演逐渐平息，没有向外的注意力来扰乱信号，她会变得对我们清晰易懂，就像一本图画书一样容易阅读。

The whole room knows when she has truly achieved the state of attention she is after, whether it's out or in. And while I am framing this in the context of a class at The Academy, I know you've experienced this exact same phenomenon, even if you've never attended a class. Maybe you've felt it in church, or in a conference room, or in a lecture hall. On your way to the concert, you weren't even sure you want to go—but as soon as the singer hit that first soaring high note, you were on your feet, dancing and screaming yourself hoarse along with everyone else in the stadium. What's certain is that this kind of legibility cannot be denied.

整个房间都知道她是否真正达到了她所追求的注意力状态，无论是向外还是向内。虽然我在这里将其框定在我的学院课程的背景下，但我知道即使你从未参加过课程，你也经历过这种现象。也许你在教堂、会议室或会场里感受过。在去音乐会的路上，你甚至不确定自己是否想去——但当歌手唱出第一个高音时，你已经站起来，和体育场里的其他人一起跳舞、歇斯底里地尖叫。可以肯定的是，这种清晰易懂是无法否认的。

---

When a state of attention is completely occupied and a person communicates their truth from that place, every body feels it land.

当一个人完全占据某种注意力状态并从那个地方展现真实的自己时，每个人都能感受到它。

---

When a woman rehearsing her Ask has embodied both extremes and touched her fears—even the ones that don't want to be seen—she makes her Ask again. When she speaks, she places her attention on the male volunteer, and we will watch the impact of every word she says as it lands in his body. She might as well be quoting scripture, or speaking a spell, because the room is riveted: we witness the power of her attention filling him with so much beautiful energy that he cannot help but say yes.

当一个女性在练习提出要求时，既体验了两种极端情绪，又面对了她的恐惧——甚至是那些不愿被看到的恐惧——她会再次提出要求。当她说话时，她将注意力集中在男性志愿者身上，我们会看到她的每一个字在他身上产生的影响。她就像在念经或施法，因为整个房间的人都被她吸引住了：我们见证了她的注意力让他充满了美妙的能量，以至于他不得不答应她。

So this is what you will see—a woman moving from her private, powerful self to a compressed, smashed mess, to a beggar, to a dominatrix, and then, finally, to the most powerful and influential public version of herself.

所以你会看到这样的场景——一个女人从她私密而强大的自我，变成一个紧缩的、崩溃的混乱状态，再到一个乞丐，再到一个女支配者，最后，成为一个最强大的、最有影响力的她。

This is congruence.

这就是一致性。

Many of us have achieved congruence by accident. Maybe you went way too far in both the whiny sub and furious domme direction while complaining to a friend over drinks, and ended up in a place that felt just right. Congruence is what happens after a long and terrible night of fighting with your spouse, when all the screaming and weeping and glass-throwing ends, all that drama crystallized into a single, true statement at four a.m.: "I am not moving to Seattle."

我们中的许多人曾在意外中达成过一致性。也许你在和朋友喝酒时抱怨，极端地表现出哀怨的被支配和愤怒的支配，最终找到了一个感觉刚刚好的状态。一致性就像是与配偶经历了漫长而痛苦的争吵之夜后，当所有的尖叫、哭泣和摔玻璃杯都结束了，在凌晨四点，你终于说出一句真实的话："我不会搬到西雅图。"

The Three-Way Ask is how you get to congruence on purpose.

三方要求就是让你有意识地达成一致性的方法。

> ### The Three-Way Ask | 三方要求
> 
> In your Mistress group, or with a trusted friend, role-play your Ask.
> 
> 在你的女主人小组中，或与一个值得信赖的朋友一起，通过角色扮演练习提出要求。
> 
> First, ask however it arises naturally.
> 
> 首先，以最自然的方式提出要求。
> 
> How are you most afraid of being perceived? Are you worried you'll seem entitled, or spoiled, greedy, the kind of big shot who needs to be brought down a notch or two? Or do you not want to seem pathetic and incapable, like a feeble, pitiful, pitiable girl? Go there. Role-play your worst fears. Ask like you're an empress ordering an execution; beg like an orphan in a Charles Dickens novel. Embody both extremes.
> 
> 你最害怕被怎么看待？你担心自己会显得自以为是、被宠坏、贪婪，像个需要被打压的大人物？还是你不想显得可怜无助，像个软弱、可怜的小女孩？去面对这些恐惧。扮演你最害怕的角色。像女皇下达处决命令一样提出要求；像查尔斯·狄更斯小说中的孤儿一样乞求。体验这两种极端。
> 
> Then watch how your Ask comes out when you ask again, for real.
>
> 然后看看当你再次真实地提出要求时，它会是什么样子。

Break the compression of the Smush, and your natural state—congruence—will follow. The power of this state cannot be denied. It took millennia for this ancient patterning to silence us, but because congruence is our natural state, it takes only minutes to undo these bindings. And when a woman accesses her entire emotional field and breaks the compression of Good Girl conditioning, when she reaches the true depth of her desires, when she gains legitimacy about it and embodies it fully and Asks from that place, there's absolutely nothing that can stop her, and nobody who wants to.

打破压抑，你的自然状态——一致性——就会显现。这种状态的力量不可否认。虽然这种古老的模式花了几千年才让我们沉默，但因为一致性是我们的自然状态，解开这些束缚只需几分钟。当一个女人完全进入她的情感领域，打破"好女孩"模式的压抑，触及自己真正的渴望，并接受这种渴望，完全体验它，再从这个状态提出要求时，没有任何东西能阻止她，也没有人会想阻止她。

#### Tell Them How You Like It: The Power of Praise Training | 告诉他们你喜欢什么：赞美训练的力量

That woman you know, who gets so well treated by the men in her life? It's not because she's the most beautiful, or because she has sex superpowers. It's because she demands it, through her Asks. And, just as she celebrates her own wins, when she catches him doing something right, she praises the shit out of what he did, and asks him for more.

你认识的那个女人，她生命中的男人都对她那么好？那不是因为她最美丽，也不是因为她有超凡的性能力。而是因为她通过她的要求表达了需求。而且，就像她庆祝自己的胜利一样，当她看到他做对了什么时，她会大力赞美他所做的，并要求他做更多。

You like how he pulled your chair out at dinner? Tell him so, and ask him to collect your wrap from the coat check. Watering the seed of what you like is going to work much better for you than pointing out the seventy-five things he did to disappoint you.

你喜欢他在晚餐时为你拉开椅子？告诉他，并让他从衣帽间取回你的披肩。浇灌你喜欢的种子，比指出他让你失望的七十五件事对你来说更有用。

I don't know where we got the idea that being stingy with praise was the way to conserve our power. When you feel like a victim, praising someone feels like you're giving something away, like you're losing points. But a woman who is moving from self-attack to self-celebration, a woman who follows what's alive, a woman who is more aware of the good in her world and is able to celebrate it, can afford to let go of whatever crumbs of power she might have gained from assuming a victim role.

我不知道我们从哪里得到了"吝啬赞美是保存力量的方法"这个想法。当你感觉像个受害者时，赞美别人感觉像是在放弃什么，就像你在丢分一样。但一个从自我攻击走向自我庆祝的女人，一个追随内心活力的女人，一个更加意识到自己世界中的美好并能够庆祝它的女人，可以放下她可能通过扮演受害者角色获得的任何微不足道的权力。

#### The Power of the Process | 过程的力量

Of course, there's no guarantee that Sari's boss will send her to Beijing. Even if she strengthens her legitimacy and feels like she has every right to Ask for what she is asking for. Even if the expression of her Ask is completely congruent, meaning that when she is talking about herself and her desire to go to Beijing, her attention is in on herself, and when she is talking to her boss about what she wants him to do and how her travel will positively impact him, her attention is completely out.

当然，不能保证萨莉的老板一定会派她去北京。即使她增强了自己的正当性，觉得自己完全有权提出这个要求。即使她的要求表达得完全一致，也就是说，当她谈论自己和去北京的渴望时，她的注意力在自己身上，而当她与老板谈论她希望他做什么以及她的旅行如何对他产生积极影响时，她的注意力完全在外。

Even with all this work, Sari's boss might still push back. This shouldn't alarm you: much of what we will do in the chapters to come will train you to negotiate resistance. But the beautiful thing about strengthening your legitimacy is that it becomes very easy to see that a no is not a no to you, but simply a no to your request. There's no need to personalize it, or to feel catastrophic about the no.

即使做了所有这些工作，萨莉的老板仍然可能会拒绝。这不应该让你感到惊慌：在接下来的章节中，我们会做很多训练来让你学会应对阻力。但增强你正当性的美妙之处在于，很容易看到一个"拒绝"并不是对你个人的否定，而只是对你的要求的拒绝。没有必要将其个人化，或对"拒绝"感到灾难性。

And when her Ask is congruent, even if he does say no the first time, Sari doesn't have any weird feelings; her body will feel good because she wasn't transmitting uncertainty to herself. She'll know she played well on this first foray, and can take what she's learned when she comes back to try again.

当她的要求一致时，即使他第一次说"不"，萨莉也不会有任何奇怪的感觉；她的身体会感觉良好，因为她没有把不确定性传递给自己。她会知道自己在这次尝试中表现得很好，并且可以在下次尝试时利用所学到的东西。

Even if that door stays shut—Sari has done some important work. She knows what she wants, and everyone in the company will know that she knows what she's worth and isn't afraid to ask for it. In cases like this, where you have done the real work, power begins before you've even opened your mouth, and the reclamation of it happens every step along the way.

即使那扇门依然紧闭——萨莉也做了一些重要的工作。她知道自己想要什么，而且公司里的每个人都会知道她知道自己的价值，并且不怕提出要求。在这种情况下，当你做了真正的工作时，力量在你开口之前就已经开始，并且在每一步中都在彰显。

What happens, for instance, when the person we most want to make a Powerful Ask of is truly, profoundly unavailable? What if they have died, or are no longer in our lives? What if you have an Ask bottled up inside, but know that the person you need resolution from will never be able to provide it? What if even communicating with that person has the potential to be physically dangerous?

例如，当我们最想对某人提出强有力的要求时，如果那个人完全无法接触到该怎么办？如果他们已经去世，或者不继续存在于我们的生活中怎么办？如果你有一个心中压抑了很久的要求，但你知道那个你需要从他那里获得解决方案的人永远无法提供怎么办？如果与那个人沟通甚至可能造成身体上的危害怎么办？

Is it even worth the work—the inner excavation of your desires, the emotional alchemy, coming up with a specific Ask—when reaching the other person seems as unlikely as growing wings and flying to a holy mountain in Bhutan?

当接触对方的可能性像长出翅膀飞到不丹的圣山一样渺茫时，是否还值得努力——挖掘内心的渴望，调整情感，想出一个具体的要求？

Yes.

是的

Yes, we are here to get what we want. But the reclamation of our power does not depend on getting a yes. Fortunately, this process is deeply beneficial—and this is true even if we never get to make the Ask in real life.

是的，我们在这里是为了得到我们想要的东西。但力量的彰显并不依赖于得到肯定的答复。幸运的是，这个过程非常有益——即使我们从未在现实生活中提出过要求，也是如此。

I am thinking of the class where my very young, very buttoned-up student Elizabeth volunteered to do a Three-Way Ask with a male volunteer: "I'm applying to law school, and I want to ask my dad to contribute five thousand dollars toward my tuition," she tells me.

我想到了一个课堂上的例子，我的一个非常年轻、非常拘谨的学生伊丽莎白自愿与一位男性志愿者进行"三方要求"练习："我正在申请法学院，我想让我爸爸为我掏五千美元学费，"她告诉我。

I tell her to ask the male volunteer, but when she turns to him, she can't get the words out. She's mumbling, meandering; it's hard to hear what she's saying, and I'm standing right next to her. I try to stay with her, but she's going so far inward, I can't follow. Now she's making half-words.

我让她向男性志愿者提出要求，但当她转向他时，她说不出话来。她在喃喃自语，语无伦次；很难听清她在说什么，而我就站在她旁边。我尽量跟着她的节奏，但她陷入内心深处，我无法跟随。现在她开始说半截话。

Since she's so deep inside, I take the risk of having her get on her knees. "Don't worry about the money for now. Just say the words: 'Please, Dad.'"

由于她陷得太深，我冒险让她跪下。"暂时不要想钱。只要说出这句话：'求求你，爸爸。'"

She says it, and says it again, but it's clearly very difficult for her; she's crying, struggling, and the room is in agony right along with her. I'd been thinking that five thousand dollars wasn't anywhere near enough for law school, but there's clearly something else going on here.

她说了一遍又一遍，但这显然对她来说非常困难；她在哭泣，在挣扎，房间里的人都和她一样痛苦。我一直认为五千美元根本不够上法学院，显然这里还有其他事情在发生。

I kneel next to her and place my hand on her back. "Please, Dad: what?" Very clearly, she says, "Please, Dad, tell me I'm good for something other than sex."

我跪在她旁边，把手放在她背上。"求求你，爸爸：什么？"她非常清楚地说，"求求你，爸爸，告诉我我除了性以外还有别的价值。"

As the story slowly starts to reveal itself, Elizabeth alternates between constrained crying and pulling herself back together. Her father would rape her when she was four and five years old, and whisper in her ear that she was good for nothing except sex. It emerges that he's a convicted sex offender who ran a child pornography ring, who never went to jail, who's still married to her mother.

随着故事慢慢展开，伊丽莎白在强忍哭泣和重新振作之间徘徊。她的父亲在她四五岁时强奸了她，并在她耳边低语说她除了性以外一无是处。后来了解到，他是一个被定罪的性犯罪者，经营着一个儿童色情团伙，从未入狱，现在仍然与她的母亲保持着婚姻关系。

I ask her: "Are you angry?" She says, "I don't know. I don't want to hurt my mother, and I really want a dad." I ask her, "Are you willing to try getting angry?" She nods and stands, barely keeping her balance. After a minute or two, she puts her attention on the volunteer.

我问她："你生气吗？"她说："我不知道。我不想伤害我妈妈，我真的想要一个爸爸。"我问她："你愿意试着生气吗？"她点点头，站了起来，几乎无法保持平衡。过了一两分钟，她把注意力集中在志愿者身上。

"You need help," she says, with the little strength she can summon. "You need help." She's choking over the words, so I tell her just to make sounds: "Growl, for that five-year-old." She makes a strange sound. "Stand over him, as though you have complete control." This helps. She finally says, "You will stop, you need help." She calls him a fucker, but weakly; her attention is all over the place.

"你需要帮助，"她用尽她仅剩的微弱力量说。"你需要帮助。"她哽咽着说不出话来，所以我告诉她只要发出声音就行："为那个五岁的孩子咆哮吧。"她发出一种奇怪的声音。"站在他面前，好像你完全控制着他。"这很有帮助。她终于说，"你会停下来的，你需要帮助。"她骂他混蛋，但声音很弱；她的注意力四处游走。

While she may not have gone all the way there, it's clear her state has changed. This progress is more than enough. She sits in the chair and I ask the volunteer to leave. She doesn't have to do the final Ask, but I ask her what she wants. She can't think of anything, so I offer some thoughts: "Do you want him to go to jail?" She nods.

虽然她可能没有完全走到那一步，但显然她的状态已经改变。这种进步已经足够了。她坐在椅子上，我请志愿者离开。她不必做最后的要求，但我问她想要什么。她一时想不出来，所以我给了一些建议："你想让他进监狱吗？"她点点头。

"Do you want him to suffer? Do you want him to write a book, confessing to your entire community what he's done?"

"你想让他受苦吗？你想让他写一本书，向整个社区坦白他所做的一切吗？"

Yes.

是的。

She takes over, starts talking. "I want him to tell my mom, who never believed me."

她接过话。"我想让他告诉我妈妈，她从来不相信我。"

"What else do you want? Be outrageous; don't settle for crumbs."

"你还想要什么？大胆一些，不要停下来。"

"I want him to give a million dollars to a foundation for the survivors of sexual abuse."

"我想让他给一个专为遭受过性虐待的人设立的基金会捐赠一百万美元。"

"Bigger."

"继续。"

"I want him to single-handedly rid the world of sexual offenders."

"我想让他单枪匹马消灭世界上的性犯罪者。"

"Amazing. Do you want him to apologize?"

"太棒了。你想让他道歉吗？"

"No, I don't want to talk to him yet. But I want a dad. A real dad, who's healed, who loves me and protects me. I feel guilty about the qualities I love in him, knowing what he did, but I want to make a dad out of the one I have. I don't think it's possible, and I don't know how."

"不，我还不想和他说话。但我想要一个爸爸。一个真正的爸爸，一个痊愈了的，爱我、保护我的爸爸。我对他的爱让我感到内疚，我知道他做了什么，但我还是想把这个人变成一个真正的爸爸。我认为这是不可能的，也不知道该怎么做。"

I tell her that she's already begun to make herself ready to receive the fatherly love she longs for—whether or not she ever speaks to her father again.

我告诉她，她已经开始让自己准备好接受她渴望的父爱了——无论她是否再和她的父亲说话。

"I feel that."

"我感觉到了。"

We stay in touch. Over the next six months, Elizabeth writes me a number of times about the impact this exercise had on her. She uses the techniques to ace all her interviews, and gets into an Ivy League law school on a scholarship; she doesn't need her father's contribution after all. She reports that she's unfazed by the toxic men she encounters at school. She's in a new relationship and enjoying her sexual power.

我们保持联系。在接下来的六个月里，伊丽莎白多次写信告诉我这次练习对她的影响。她利用这些技巧在所有面试中表现出色，并获得了常春藤盟校法学院的奖学金；她无需她父亲的资助。她说她对在学校遇到的渣男毫不在意。她有了新的恋情，并享受着性的力量。

But it's only after six months that Elizabeth tells me what she's really been up to: while achieving all these other astonishing victories, she also decided to volunteer to counsel inmates, the majority of whom are sex offenders, and many of whom have been sexually abused in jail. She chose this as her training ground, should she ever encounter her father again. "I taught myself to be calm in their presence, to listen, to understand—and to prepare for facing my dad and getting what I want: his healing and a real dad. And I don't care if I ever get there—every step in this process has brought me closer to who I want to be."

但直到六个月后，伊丽莎白才告诉我她真正的计划：在取得所有这些惊人胜利的同时，她还决定志愿为囚犯提供咨询服务，其中大多数是性犯罪者，许多人在监狱中也遭受过性虐待。她选择这里作为她的训练场，以备将来再次遇到她的父亲。"我教自己在他们面前保持冷静，倾听，理解——并为面对我的父亲和得到我想要的东西做好准备：他的痊愈和一个真正的爸爸。而且我不在乎是否能实现——这个过程中每一步都让我更接近我想成为的那个人。"
