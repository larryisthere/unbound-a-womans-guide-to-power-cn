# INTRODUCTION | 介绍

## THE CALL TO POWER | 力量的召唤
 
This book is a training manual for battle. It will prepare you for war when it's necessary and skillful collaboration when you desire it. It is a field guide to the impossible, the outrageous, the unimaginable. It contains instructions for achieving unattainable goals, ones so far out of your reach you feel stupid or crazy thinking them, let alone saying them out loud.

这本书是一本战斗训练手册。它会在必要时为你准备战斗，在你渴望时为你准备熟练的协作。它是一本关于不可能、骇人听闻、无法想象之事的实战指南。它包含了实现遥不可及目标的指导，那些目标远在你的能力范围之外，让你觉得想它们都是愚蠢或疯狂的，更不用说大声说出来了。

It is an education in breaking the ingrained conditioning that keeps women silent and accommodating when we should be expressing ourselves and having influence. It will teach you to know what you want and how to get it, which will change the world around you.

这是一种教育，旨在打破根深蒂固的好女孩模式，这种模式让女性在我们应该表达自己并产生影响时保持沉默和顺从。它会教你了解自己想要什么以及如何获得它，这将改变你周围的世界。

It is a guide to power.

这是一本关于力量的指南。

My name is Kasia Urbaniak, and I spent seventeen years studying to become a Taoist nun while working as one of the most successful dominatrices in the world.

我的名字是卡西亚·乌尔班尼亚克，我花了十七年时间学习成为一名道教修女，同时作为世界上最成功的女支配者之一工作。

These seemingly contradictory tracks gave me unexpected and unprecedented insight into how power works. In studying Taoism around the globe, I learned to read the human body, so I'd know a person's intention to attack or retreat before they'd moved a muscle or uttered a word. It taught me to follow and trust what's most alive—what's humming with energy and possibility.

这两段看似矛盾的经历给了我意想不到且前所未有的洞察力，让我了解力量是如何运作的。在全球学习道教的过程中，我学会了读懂人体，这样我就能在一个人移动肌肉或说出一句话之前，知道他们的攻击或撤退意图。它教会我跟随和信任最有活力的东西——那些充满能量和可能性、生机勃勃的东西。

From my work in the dungeon, I learned all the ways that imagination can heal us and help us to discover deep emotional truths. In playing games with power, I learned to differentiate between real authority and a performance of it.

从我在密室的工作中，我学到了想象力能够治愈我们并帮助我们发现深层情感真相的所有方式。在玩力量游戏时，我学会了区分真正的权威和对其的表演。

From both, I learned about power dynamics: influence on others that exists beyond the level of language alone.

从两者中，我学到了权力动态：对他人产生影响，这种影响超越了语言层面的影响。

In 2012, I founded a school with Ruben Flores, an emergency field coordinator for the humanitarian organization Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), to teach other women what I had learned. At the beginning, our school felt like an exclusive but growing secret society of powerful women whose headquarters just happened to be my Manhattan apartment. We were a modern-day, real-world Bene Gesserit, a coven of the righteous, planning world domination and achieving it.

2012年，我与鲁本·弗洛雷斯共同创立了一所学校，他是人道主义组织无国界医生组织的紧急现场协调员，目的是教授其他女性我所学到的东西。起初，我们的学校感觉像一个排外但不断壮大的强大女性秘密社团，其总部恰好就在我在曼哈顿的公寓里。我们是现代版的、真实世界的贝尼·杰瑟里特，一个正义的团体，策划着世界统治并实现它。

注：贝尼·杰瑟里特（Bene Gesserit）是科幻小说《沙丘》系列中的一个女性组织，以智慧和影响力著称。

But in 2018, many women began speaking out about their lived experiences of sexual harassment and assault, which gave rise to larger cultural conversations about feelings of powerlessness in family units, in romantic and sexual relationships, and in the workplace.

但在2018年，许多女性开始公开谈论她们遭受性骚扰和性侵犯的经历，这引发了关于在家庭单位、浪漫和性关系以及工作场所中无力感的文化对话。

As the #MeToo movement gathered speed, women at large started speaking a truth that my students already knew and had trained for, that most—if not all—of us had clutched in a high-stakes, high-stress situation.

随着#MeToo运动加速发展，广大女性开始说出一个我的学生们已经知道并训练过的真相，那就是我们中的大多数人——如果不是所有人——都曾在高风险、高压力的情况下体会过这个真相。

When it was most important for us to know and speak our truth, we were unable to.

当我们最需要知道并说出真相时，我们却无法做到。

The world is on fire, and the concepts I teach are ones that every woman should have access to. That is why I am writing this book.

世界正在燃烧，我教授的概念应该是每个女性都能接触到的。这就是我写这本书的原因。

This book will inoculate you against "no" and resistance of all kinds, including your own. It will help you to identify the life-force, the juice, the beautiful moving energy in every interaction, which is the key to understanding true desire. It will provide you with a constructive channel for all of the rage every woman has spent her adult life tamping down. And it will teach you to harness one of the most powerful weapons we have—your attention.

这本书会让你对"不"和各种阻力免疫，包括你自己的阻力。它会帮助你识别每一次互动中的生命力、精华、美丽流动的能量，这是理解真正渴望的关键。它会为你提供一个建设性的渠道，来释放每个女性在成年生活中一直压抑的所有愤怒。它会教你利用我们拥有的最强大的武器之一——你的注意力。

And while there will be erotic absurdity and transcendent insight, what I really want to share with you is what I discovered underneath every interaction. Because power isn't a mood, an outfit, a moment, or a pose. It is the ability to access your deepest desires, express them fully, and use them to influence other people and the world at large.

虽然会有情色荒谬和超越性洞察，但我真正想与你分享的是我在每一次互动之下发现的。因为力量不是一种情绪、一套服装、一个时刻或一个姿势。它是获取你最深层渴望、充分表达它们、并用它们影响他人和整个世界的能力。

Ultimately, this book is about relationships—in the den, in the bedroom, in the workplace, in Congress, and at the bar. It is about the dynamics that define them and decide their fate. It is about strength and vulnerability, dominance and surrender, and how each affects the flow of love, power, and influence.

最终，这本书是关于关系的——在密室、在卧室、在工作场所、在国会、在酒吧。它是关于定义它们并决定它们命运的动态。它是关于力量与脆弱、支配与屈服，以及每一个如何影响爱、力量和影响力的流动。

I use binary terms—man and woman—when I speak about gender, not because I see gender as binary, but because my work is so deeply rooted in the cultural conditioning that all of us received when we were assigned "male" or "female" at birth. Regardless of how you identify now, the expectations of and treatment by your parents and society at large imprinted you, and make a difference in the way you behave in relationship to others.

我在谈论性别时使用二元术语——男人和女人——不是因为我将性别视为二元，而是因为我的工作深深植根于我们在出生时被分配为"男性"或"女性"时所有人收到的文化模式。无论你现在如何认同自己，你的父母和整个社会的期望和对待方式都印记在你身上，并影响你在与他人关系中的行为方式。

You'll also notice that many of the examples I use are heteronormative. Much of what I teach addresses the ways that women have been conditioned to interact with men, including as romantic partners. But the behaviors outlined within these pages can be used with a spouse, sparring partner, coworker, friend, child, parent, or lover of any gender. Breaking the ties that bind will allow you freer, more powerful communication—with everyone.

你还会注意到我使用的许多例子都是异性恋规范的。我教授的很多内容都涉及女性被好女孩模式塑造后与男性互动的方式，包括作为浪漫伴侣。但这些页面中概述的行为可以与任何性别的配偶、练习伙伴、同事、朋友、孩子、父母或恋人一起使用。打破束缚的纽带会让你与他人进行更自由、更有力的沟通——与每个人。

When you play skillfully with power dynamics, the world changes. You stop being a servant of the life you're living and become a creator of the world you want.

当你巧妙地运用权力动态时，世界就会改变。你不再是你所生活的生命的仆人，而是成为你想要创造的世界的创造者。

Let's get started.

让我们开始吧。
