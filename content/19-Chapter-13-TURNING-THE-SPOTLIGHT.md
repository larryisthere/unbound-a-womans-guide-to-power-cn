# Chapter 13: TURNING THE SPOTLIGHT | 第十三章：转向聚光灯

## The Power to Break the Freeze | 打破冻结的力量

Nice view,” your new spin instructor jokes as you lean forward.

"好风景，"你的新旋转课教练在你向前倾时开玩笑。

"I love how exotic you look," says the guy on the next barstool. "Where are you from?"

"我喜欢你看起来多么异国情调，"隔壁吧台凳上的家伙说。"你来自哪里？"

Ro's husband asks her how she wants to celebrate their tenth anniversary, and the answer is on the tip of her tongue: what she really wants—more than a necklace or a trip—is the courage to tell him that he's never made her come.

萝的丈夫问她想要如何庆祝他们的十周年纪念日，答案就在她的舌尖上：她真正想要的——比项链或旅行更重要的是——是告诉他他从未让她达到高潮的勇气。

We're going to pivot now, from difficult conversations and Outrageous Asks that you can prepare for, to some resources you can use when someone blindsides you.

我们现在要转向，从你可以准备的困难对话和出格要求，转向一些当你被某人突然袭击时可以使用的资源。

Every woman I know has experienced what I call the Freeze: a moment of neuromuscular lockdown that comes after a proposition or a betrayal or a certain kind of inappropriate or difficult question. The mind searches frantically for a response, while the body is unable to move. What follows is speechlessness, or its equivalent; you cannot speak, or you say yes, implying consent and agreement when in fact you're desperate to say no.

我认识的每个女人都经历过我所说的冻结（Freeze）：在提议、背叛或某种不合适或困难的问题之后出现的神经肌肉锁定时刻。头脑疯狂地搜索回应，而身体无法移动。随之而来的是无言，或等同的情况；你不能说话，或者说"是"，暗示同意和认可，而实际上你迫切想说"不"。

Life means that we will sometimes be blindsided by an unforeseen attack—a comment, inappropriate or not, that catches us totally off guard. These are moments that no repetition of the Legitimacy exercise would prepare us for. But we can train for them—and in this chapter, we will.

生活意味着我们有时会被意外的攻击袭击——一个评论，无论是否不合适，都会让我们完全措手不及。这些是没有任何正当性练习的重复可以为我们准备的时刻。但我们可以为它们训练——在这一章中，我们将这样做。

What follows in this chapter is a verbal self-defense dojo, which will train you in the kind of jujitsu you will need to break this Freeze, in both high-stakes scenarios and low-. But these aren't just techniques you can use in moments of crisis. What you will learn here is especially useful because it can also be applied, with some calibration, when you need to keep your attention out to navigate someone else's resistance.

本章接下来的是一个口头自卫道场，它将训练你掌握打破这种冻结所需的柔道技巧，无论在高风险场景还是低风险场景中。但这些不仅仅是你在危机时刻可以使用的技巧。你在这里学到的特别有用，因为它也可以应用，经过一些校准，当你需要保持注意力向外以应对他人的抵抗时。

Before we begin your training, I'd like to be clear about two things.

在我们开始训练之前，我想明确两点。

The first: There is nothing inherently dangerous about silence. There are many scenarios where not saying anything is a valid and powerful choice. The decision to choose silence is different from the Freeze. When you opt for silence, you are exercising agency—to speak, to stay silent, to walk away. When you're frozen, your nervous system feels like it's been hijacked; even if you want to, you cannot speak or respond powerfully. These skills are for those moments.

第一：沉默本身并不危险。在许多情况下，不说什么是一个有效和强大的选择。选择沉默的决定不同于冻结。当你选择沉默时，你在行使能动性——说话、保持沉默、走开。当你被冻结时，你的神经系统感觉像被劫持了；即使你想，你也不能说话或有力地回应。这些技能是为了那些时刻。

The second is that, despite the dojo metaphor, these techniques were not designed to help you navigate dangerous or violent people. If you think you may be in danger, do not stay to play. Leave the situation as quickly as possible.

第二是，尽管有道场的比喻，这些技巧并不是为了帮助你应对危险或暴力的人而设计的。如果你认为你可能处于危险中，不要留下来玩。尽快离开情况。

It will be powerful, although not necessary, to do the work in this chapter with your Mistress group. These skills increase in value as you gain proficiency, and the way to gain real facility is through practice; when you run these drills with other women, you're honing your reflexes in a safe environment. In the meantime, you can cheer your fellow Mistresses' elegant responses, and find inspiration in one another's power plays.

与你的女主人小组一起做这一章的工作将是有力的，虽然不是必要的。这些技能会随着你熟练度的提高而增值，获得真正熟练的方法是练习；当你与其他女性一起进行这些练习时，你在安全的环境中磨练你的反应。同时，你可以为你的女主人同伴优雅的回应喝彩，并从彼此的权力游戏中找到灵感。

### Why This Matters So Much: The Hidden Costs of the Freeze | 为什么这如此重要：冻结的隐藏成本

There is a moment that breaks my heart in every class I've ever done:

在我教过的每一堂课中，都有一个让我心碎的时刻：

"How many of you have had sex you didn't want?" I ask—and the whole room raises a hand.

"你们中有多少人经历过你们不想要的性行为？"我问——整个房间的人都举起了手。

Or I ask, "What's the last thing you wanted to say no to but didn't?" and the answers range from picking up his boxers to having a baby she didn't want. "I didn't say no when my husband wanted to have make-up sex after our fight." "I didn't say no when my high-school art teacher showed me a book of nudes and asked how they made me feel." "I didn't say no when the DA told me he was reducing the charges against the man who molested me because he didn't think I was strong enough to take the stand."

或者我问，"你最后想说不但没有说的事情是什么？"答案从捡起他的内裤到生一个她不想要的孩子不等。"我没有在我丈夫想要在我们打架后做和解性爱时说不。""我没有在我的高中艺术老师给我看一本裸体画册并问我它们让我感觉如何时说不。""我没有在地区检察官告诉我他要减少对猥亵我的男人的指控，因为他认为我不够坚强无法出庭作证时说不。"

This is the first, devastating cost of the Freeze: things happen to us that we do not want to happen, and we are powerless to stop them. We end up in compromising positions, or shouldering responsibilities that we absolutely can't afford to take on, or agreeing to an agenda that we know deep down in our hearts is wrong.

这是冻结的第一个、毁灭性的成本：我们不希望发生的事情发生在我们身上，我们无力阻止它们。我们最终处于妥协的立场，或承担我们绝对承担不起的责任，或同意我们内心深处知道是错的议程。

This alone would be too dear a price to pay. But there are other, less obvious costs to the Freeze. One of those is the other party walking away with an assumption that just isn't true. Maybe he thinks you're a dumb bunny or a pushover—nicer, or more of a cold fish than you really are. We can tell ourselves that it doesn't really matter what he thinks, but when you add up all the times you weren't able to speak, you may come away feeling that you didn't really have influence in the world—"that my vote didn't count because the ballot got stuck in my throat," as one of my students memorably described it. Or that by silently agreeing to the status assigned to you, you have missed opportunities to be seen for who you really are.

仅此一项就太昂贵了。但冻结还有其他不那么明显的成本。其中之一是对方带着一个不真实的假设离开。也许他认为你是个蠢兔子或软柿子——比你实际上更友善，或更冷漠。我们可以告诉自己他想什么并不重要，但当你把所有无法说话的时刻加起来时，你可能会觉得自己在世界上没有真正的影响力——"我的投票没有算数，因为选票卡在了我的喉咙里，"我的一个学生令人难忘地描述道。或者通过默默地同意分配给你的身份，你错过了被看到真实自我的机会。

And, of course, not speaking comes with a heavy tax that we impose on ourselves, which is shame.

当然，不说话会给我们自己带来沉重的税赋，那就是羞耻。

I've seen over and over how these moments of speechlessness completely alter the course of women's lives. Alison came to me looking for romantic advice. When I asked about her job, she told me she was working as an executive assistant after giving up her dream of being a comedian.

我一遍又一遍地看到这些无言时刻如何完全改变女性的生活轨迹。艾莉森来找我寻求浪漫建议。当我问她的工作时，她告诉我她在放弃成为喜剧演员的梦想后从事行政助理工作。

I nodded—comedy is notoriously hard to break into. But that hadn't been the problem: in fact, Alison had been successful, booked year-round in clubs that were getting bigger all the time.

我点头——喜剧是出了名的难进入。但这不是问题：事实上，艾莉森一直很成功，全年都在不断壮大的俱乐部演出。

"I just wasn't cut out for it," she told me. But then she described taping Saturday Night Live every weekend as a kid, so that she could painstakingly transcribe her favorite sketches word-for-word, taking them apart to analyze how they worked before writing and acting out her own.

"我只是不适合做这个，"她告诉我。但然后她描述了小时候每个周末录制《周六夜现场》，以便她可以辛苦地逐字转录她最喜欢的短剧，拆解它们来分析它们是如何运作的，然后再写和表演她自己的。

So what did she mean when she said that she wasn't "cut out" for comedy, given that it was the only thing she'd ever wanted to do? Had the dingy motel rooms in random college towns gotten to her, dinners scrounged in the early hours of the morning from vending machines? No: those trips had always felt like a wonderful adventure to her. Being on the road ten months out of the year made it tough to have a pet, let alone a relationship, didn't it? She shrugged; she'd never been a homebody. Was it the depressing, half-empty bars, the belligerent drunks and hecklers? Nope—she loved a challenge, and had come up with some of her most provocative material trying to win over those difficult rooms.

那么，当她说她不适合喜剧时，她是什么意思，因为这是她唯一想要做的事情？是随机的大学城里的破旧汽车旅馆房间让她受不了吗，还是从自动售货机里凑合的凌晨晚餐？不：那些旅行对她来说总是一次美妙的冒险。一年中十个月在路上使得养宠物很困难，更不用说关系了，不是吗？她耸耸肩；她从来不是一个居家的人。是令人沮丧的半空酒吧，好战的醉汉和起哄者吗？不——她喜欢挑战，并且想出了一些她最大胆的材料来试图赢得那些困难的房间。

Except that a well-regarded male comedian had said something to her after a gig that had made Alison go speechless; she froze. What he said isn't important—in fact, when she was telling me about it, she couldn't even remember exactly what he'd said. What she did remember, and couldn't stop punishing herself for, was the shame she felt over freezing—the fact that she hadn't said or done anything to stand up for herself. That event, and two more moments of freezing—an inability to come to her own defense—over the following months, had convinced Alison that she wasn't "cut out" for a life in comedy.

除了一个备受尊敬的男性喜剧演员在一次演出后对她说了什么，这让艾莉森变得无言；她冻结了。他说了什么并不重要——事实上，当她告诉我这件事时，她甚至不记得他到底说了什么。她确实记得，并且无法停止为此惩罚自己的，是她对冻结感到的羞耻——她没有说或做任何为自己辩护的事情的事实。那次事件，以及接下来几个月中另外两次冻结时刻——无法为自己辩护——使艾莉森确信她不适合喜剧生活。

Three times, she had frozen instead of speaking, and the rot had gone deep. Alison felt she'd sold herself out. The way she internalized those experiences led to her making devastating assessments about her aptitude for the work and her capacity to continue with it, so that she dashed her childhood dreams and threw away countless hours of happy work as an adult. That's not just a disservice to her, by the way, but to the whole world, because when someone lives out her life's true purpose, it matters. But Alison never got that, and we never got what she had to give—all because of those three experiences of the Freeze.

三次，她冻结了而不是说话，腐烂已经深入。艾莉森觉得她出卖了自己。她内化这些经历的方式导致她对自己的工作天赋和继续工作能力的毁灭性评估，以至于她破灭了童年的梦想，抛弃了成年后无数小时的快乐工作。顺便说一句，这不仅对她不公平，对整个世界也不公平，因为当某人实现她人生的真正目的时，这很重要。但艾莉森从未得到这一点，我们也从未得到她必须给予的东西——都是因为那三次冻结的经历。

The Freeze may also mean that we do not deliver important feedback to the person who is harming us. Perhaps they don't suspect they've put you on the spot, and would stop if they did; perhaps, if you could speak, they would proceed differently with the next woman they encountered. Or maybe they are deliberately muddying the water, taking advantage of the fact that you can't accurately evaluate what's going on. Because the Freeze doesn't just limit our voices, it limits our perception, or our ability to gauge the safety of an interaction. Break the Freeze, and you reclaim not only your voice, but the ability to cut through the fog of these murky scenarios.

冻结也可能意味着我们没有向伤害我们的人提供重要的反馈。也许他们没有怀疑他们把你置于困境中，如果他们知道的话会停止；也许，如果你能说话，他们会对他们遇到的下一个女人采取不同的方式。或者他们故意搅浑水，利用你无法准确评估正在发生的事情的事实。因为冻结不仅限制了我们的声音，它还限制了我们的感知，或我们评估互动安全性的能力。打破冻结，你不仅重新获得你的声音，还有穿透这些模糊场景迷雾的能力。

We will talk about how to clarify these ambiguous communications in the next chapter. For now, we need to teach you how to get off the spot—and how to stay off it.

我们将在下一章讨论如何澄清这些模糊的交流。现在，我们需要教你如何摆脱困境——以及如何远离它。

### Turning the Spotlight | 转向聚光灯

You're already holding the magic bullet, the one that is guaranteed to get you off the spot: ask a question.

你已经掌握了魔法子弹，那个保证能让你摆脱困境的东西：问一个问题。

Questions are a domme superpower, for two reasons. First: When you ask a question, you wait for an answer—you turn your attention out, and curiosity keeps it there, even if just for a second. Second: To answer a question, the other person has to go inside. Even if it's for a nanosecond, they have to pay attention to themselves.

问题是女支配者的超能力，有两个原因。第一：当你问一个问题时，你等待答案——你把注意力转向外，好奇心让它保持在那边，即使只有一秒钟。第二：要回答一个问题，对方必须向内。即使只有一纳秒，他们必须关注自己。

This is how you flip the power dynamic, breaking the Freeze: your attention moves out, and theirs moves in.

这就是你翻转权力动态、打破冻结的方式：你的注意力向外移动，而他们的向内移动。

That's how it works on paper, anyway. In class, we practice and practice and practice—and even with all the cheerleading from their peers, not to mention me modeling and pushing, it takes an enormous effort for women to get far enough out.

至少理论上是这样工作的。在课堂上，我们练习、练习、再练习——即使有同伴们的所有鼓励，更不用说我的示范和推动，女性要足够向外需要巨大的努力。

I have students tower over the volunteer, straddle him, grab his hair. "Violate his personal space," I tell them. "Be a bully. Breach his defenses. Invade! Pillage! Dominate!" I have them insult him, and yell, and mash his face with their hands. I give them a riding crop and tell them to push the point into his chest: "Penetrate him! Pierce him! Follow the crop and pin him with your gaze and attention," I coach. "When your attention is all the way out, you should be able to take his pulse just through the intensity of your gaze."

我让学生们俯视志愿者，跨坐在他身上，抓住他的头发。"侵犯他的个人空间，"我告诉他们。"做个恶霸。突破他的防线。入侵！掠夺！支配！"我让他们侮辱他，大喊，用他们的手压他的脸。我给他们一个马鞭，告诉他们把尖端推入他的胸口："穿透他！刺穿他！跟随马鞭，用你的凝视和注意力固定他，"我指导。"当你的注意力完全向外时，你应该能够仅通过你的凝视强度来感受他的脉搏。"

Even with all this, it can take a few minutes for a woman to shed the make-nice, make-yourself-small habits of the Good Girl. But we stay with it, because this is what's required.

即使有所有这些，一个女人可能需要几分钟才能摆脱好女孩的友善、让自己变小习惯。但我们坚持下去，因为这是所需要的。

Most of my students are already great lovers, great mothers, great therapists, great nonviolent communicators—Good Girl conditioning and the world we live in has taught them those things. But right now, women are at war. The average Academy student doesn't need her waiter to think she's nice—she needs to be able to confront the father-in-law she suspects has designs on her eleven-year-old daughter, the husband who is siphoning her inheritance, a higher-up whose unethical practices quite literally threaten the world's food supply. These women don't need to be better mommies; they need to be Ruthless Motherfucking Ninjas.

我的大多数学生已经是伟大的爱人、伟大的母亲、伟大的治疗师、伟大的非暴力沟通者——好女孩模式和我们生活的世界教会了她们这些。但现在，女性正在战争中。普通的学院学生不需要她的服务员认为她很好——她需要能够面对她怀疑对她十一岁女儿有企图的岳父，挪用她遗产的丈夫，其不道德做法实际上威胁世界食品供应的上级。这些女性不需要成为更好的妈妈；她们需要成为无情的他妈的忍者。

Which is to say: as you practice the exercises that follow with your Mistress group, be ruthless, and be honest with one another about what you see. Further than you think is likely just about right.

也就是说：当你与你的女主人小组一起练习下面的练习时，要无情，并对彼此诚实地说明你看到的。比你想象的更进一步可能正好是对的。

#### EXERCISE | 练习

##### Uncomfortable Questions | 不舒服的问题

This exercise is really, really fun to do in a group setting, but works just as well done solo as long as you're in a safe, private space—somewhere you'll feel comfortable talking back to your book or screen.

这个练习在小组环境中做真的、真的很有趣，但单独做也完全有效，只要你在一个安全、私密的空间——某个你会感到舒适地对你的书或屏幕回话的地方。

If you do this in a group setting, one person volunteers to ask the questions; the rest of you come up with as many questions in response to the question as you can yell out before moving on to the next one. Turn your attention out, onto the asker.

如果你在小组环境中这样做，一个人自愿问问题；你们其他人想出尽可能多的问题来回应问题，在继续下一个之前尽可能多地喊出来。把你的注意力转向外，放在提问者身上。

Do not answer the uncomfortable question. Your return questions can be as funny or as raunchy or as snarky or as kind as you'd like. They can be relevant, or total non sequiturs.

不要回答不舒服的问题。你的回应问题可以像你想要的那样有趣、粗俗、刻薄或友善。它们可以相关，也可以完全不相关。

Use your return question to move the attention off you and onto the asker. Double points if you ask a question about their question; triple points if you question the legitimacy of their question. But if you're stuck, remember you can always just ask them where they got their tie.

用你的回应问题将注意力从你身上移开，转移到提问者身上。如果你问一个关于他们问题的问题，双倍分数；如果你质疑他们问题的正当性，三倍分数。但如果你卡住了，记住你总是可以问他们从哪里得到的领带。

The list below is taken from the People Can Be Truly Terrible circular file I've gathered from my students over the years. Use these, or consider them inspiration to make up your own, knowing that the questions most likely to trigger a Freeze for some of my students are often the deceptively simple ones like "What do you do for a living?"

下面的列表来自我多年来从学生那里收集的"人们可能真的很糟糕"的循环文件。使用这些，或者把它们作为灵感来编造你自己的，知道最可能触发我一些学生冻结的问题往往是那些看似简单的问题，比如"你做什么工作？"

Allow yourself to imagine being blindsided in a range of contexts: at a party, on a job interview, on a first date.

允许自己想象在一系列情境中被突然袭击：在聚会上，在求职面试中，在第一次约会时。

"Why don't you have kids?"

"你为什么没有孩子？"

"Are you married?"

"你结婚了吗？"

"Don't you think that affirmative action is kind of unfair?"

"你不觉得平权行动有点不公平吗？"

"How old are you?"

"你多大了？"

"Are you pregnant?"

"你怀孕了吗？"

"Have you put on weight?" "Oh, are you eating bread again?"

"你长胖了吗？" "哦，你又在吃面包了吗？"

"What are you?" "Where are you from?" "Are you Jewish?" "When did you come to America?"

"你是什么人？" "你来自哪里？" "你是犹太人吗？" "你什么时候来美国的？"

"So have you published anything real?"

"那么你发表过什么真正的东西吗？"

"Does your husband mind that you make more money than he does?"

"你丈夫介意你比他赚得多吗？"

"Have you gone on any dates since he left you?"

"自从他离开你后，你去过约会吗？"

"I guess you're a lesbian because you were molested?" "So which one of you is the guy in your relationship?"

"我猜你是女同性恋因为你被猥亵了？" "那么你们谁在关系中扮演男性角色？"

"Did you have to sleep with someone to get this job?"

"你必须和某人睡觉才能得到这份工作吗？"

"Did you have to have a mastectomy?" "Were you scared you were going to die?" "Were your kids scared that you were going to die?"

"你必须做乳房切除术吗？" "你害怕你会死吗？" "你的孩子们害怕你会死吗？"

Sometimes a question will not even seem that uncomfortable. "Are you single?"—indeed, it might seem easier to answer the question than to think of one to ask back. Do not answer the question. Ask one instead, like: "Why do you want to know?" "Did you just ask me what I think you asked me?" "Do you realize a question like that could make a woman feel very uncomfortable?"

有时一个问题甚至看起来不那么不舒服。"你是单身吗？"——确实，回答这个问题可能比想一个回应的问题更容易。不要回答这个问题。相反，问一个，比如："你为什么想知道？" "你刚才问我我想你问我的那个吗？" "你意识到像这样的问题可能让一个女人感到非常不舒服吗？"

Don't worry too much about calibration (about being too harsh or too tame); for now, it's enough just to play at Turning the Spotlight. As you go, take note of moments when your attention turns inward and you experience the Freeze.

不要太担心校准（关于太严厉或太温和）；现在，只是练习转向聚光灯就足够了。当你进行时，注意你的注意力转向内和你经历冻结的时刻。

It's tricky to keep your attention out, isn't it? You probably did notice how much more fluidly your responses came after you'd had a little practice.

保持你的注意力向外是很棘手的，不是吗？你可能确实注意到在你有一点练习后，你的回应来得多么流畅。

But I'm not content to train you so that you can do this exercise. I want you to be able to rely on your ability to direct your attention in any and all situations—including the most squirm-inducing, confronting, disorienting ones you find yourself in.

但我不满足于训练你以便你能做这个练习。我希望你能够依赖你在任何和所有情况下引导注意力的能力——包括你发现自己处于的最令人不安、面对、迷失方向的情况。

This is where The Jason comes in. This technique, which I developed when I was tasked with training new dominatrices, will serve as an attention-out boot camp.

这就是杰森（The Jason）的用武之地。这个技巧，是我在负责训练新的女支配者时开发的，将作为注意力向外的训练营。

### How to Get on Top—and Stay There | 如何占据上风——并保持在那里

Sex, as you may or may not know, is explicitly forbidden in a dungeon. This is true across the board, and it is nonnegotiable—which does not stop a specific kind of creep. He always picks the new girl, and he gets off on bullying her, on trying to get her to cross a line. Of course, sex workers are particularly vulnerable to this kind of harassment because of the nature of the work; there's no HR department in a professional dungeon.

性，你可能知道也可能不知道，在地牢中是被明确禁止的。这在所有情况下都是如此，而且不可协商——这并不能阻止特定类型的变态。他总是选择新女孩，他通过欺负她来获得快感，试图让她越过界线。当然，性工作者由于工作的性质特别容易受到这种骚扰；在专业地牢中没有人力资源部门。

He says, "This is great and all, but when are we going to fuck?"

他说，"这很好，但我们什么时候要做爱？"

What often happens, especially with a less experienced woman, is that she Freezes. Her attention turns inward: "What did I do that made him think he could say that to me? And what do I do now?"

经常发生的事情，特别是对经验较少的女性来说，是她冻结了。她的注意力转向内："我做了什么让他认为他可以对我说那个？我现在该做什么？"

But if her attention is turned in, how is she going to recover the power dynamic? It's her job for the next hour to be the boss of him, and in the first five minutes, he's turned that upside down. He's in control of the conversation, asking the questions and making the demands—and her response has been to go sub, to turn her attention in. But if her attention stays in, she's not going to be in control of anyone. She's going to spend the next fifty-nine long minutes being dominated.

但如果她的注意力转向内，她如何恢复权力动态？在接下来的一个小时里，她的工作是成为他的老板，而在前五分钟，他已经把这一切颠倒了。他控制了对话，问问题并提出要求——而她的回应是变得顺从，把注意力转向内。但如果她的注意力保持向内，她将无法控制任何人。她将在接下来的五十九分钟里被支配。

What she needs to do is get on top—and stay there. To practice how to do this, we are going to use the same tool we use to break the Freeze: the power of the question. But you're going to keep it going. Turn your attention out by asking a question, and then keep it out by asking another question, and another one, and another one.

她需要做的是占据上风——并保持在那里。为了练习如何做到这一点，我们将使用我们用来打破冻结的相同工具：问题的力量。但你要保持它继续。通过问一个问题来把你的注意力转向外，然后通过问另一个问题、再一个、再一个来保持它向外。

#### EXERCISE | 练习

##### The Jason | 杰森

I use male volunteers when I'm training women to keep their attention out. In fact, this exercise is named after the intrepid volunteer who first let us play with him in this way. (Our school would not be possible without these generous men.)

当我在训练女性保持注意力向外时，我使用男性志愿者。事实上，这个练习是以首先让我们以这种方式与他一起玩的勇敢志愿者命名的。（没有这些慷慨的男人，我们的学校是不可能的。）

I hand my student a riding crop and tell her not to let him get a word in edgewise. She has to keep the flow of her attention and language out, keeping him in his place.

我给我的学生一个马鞭，告诉她不要让他插话。她必须保持她的注意力和语言流向外，让他保持在他的位置。

This is a perfect exercise to do with your Mistress group, or with a trusted friend playing the obnoxious man. It's fun to play dungeon, so you may want to start this exercise with one partner saying, "This is great and all, but when are we going to fuck?" If you'd prefer to do something different, you can also go back to the original Uncomfortable Questions and ask them again—but the partner being asked, the one Turning the Spotlight, won't stop after she's asked a single question: she'll keep going.

这是一个与你的女主人小组或与一个值得信赖的朋友扮演讨厌男人一起做的完美练习。扮演地牢很有趣，所以你可能想从一个伙伴说"这很好，但我们什么时候要做爱？"开始这个练习。如果你更喜欢做一些不同的事情，你也可以回到原来的不舒服问题并再次问它们——但被问的伙伴，那个转向聚光灯的人，在她问了一个问题后不会停止：她会继续。

You're not just Turning the Spotlight, but keeping it on your partner as you build an endless stream of questions. Keep going as long as you can, even after you feel like you've ventured into the territory of the absurd. Be patient with your own pauses when it takes you a minute to come up with the next question. These will disappear in time, and with practice.

你不仅仅是转向聚光灯，而是在你建立无尽问题流时把它保持在你的伙伴身上。尽可能长时间地继续，即使在你感觉你已经进入了荒谬的领域之后。当你需要一分钟来想出下一个问题时，对你自己的停顿要有耐心。这些会随着时间和练习而消失。

And be mindful that you don't turn inward to find the next question! This is an open-book test: if you're stuck, ask your next question based on what you see in front of you. "Was that a smirk I just saw on your face?" "Are you cowering away from me now?" Even, "Where the hell did you get those stupid socks?"

要注意你不要向内转去找下一个问题！这是一个开卷测试：如果你卡住了，根据你在面前看到的东西问你的下一个问题。"我刚才在你脸上看到的那个是傻笑吗？" "你现在在我面前畏缩吗？"甚至，"你到底从哪里得到那些愚蠢的袜子的？"

Take note of what happened to you in your body when you felt yourself moving into the dominant state of attention.

注意当你感觉到自己进入支配注意力状态时，你的身体发生了什么。

Did you find yourself getting closer to the person you were moving into the submissive state of attention—maybe even uncomfortably close? If you started seated, did you find that you got to your feet, even if it meant standing over them and looking down at them in an intimidating way? Did your voice deepen? Was it softer or louder? Could you feel that your voice had a physical weight that the other person could feel, like a steadying hand on the shoulder? What about your gaze? Was it focused? Penetrating? Reassuring?

你有没有发现自己离你正在转向顺从注意力状态的人更近——也许甚至不舒服地近？如果你开始是坐着的，你有没有发现自己站起来，即使这意味着站在他们上方，以恐吓的方式俯视他们？你的声音变深了吗？它更柔和还是更大声？你能感觉到你的声音有一种物理重量，对方能感觉到，就像肩膀上的一只稳定手吗？你的凝视呢？它是专注的吗？穿透的吗？令人安心的吗？

These aren't "tips and tricks" to get you into the dominant state—they are by-products of your state of attention, not the cause of it.

这些不是让你进入支配状态的"提示和技巧"——它们是你的注意力状态的副产品，而不是原因。

Language and physical contact help lead attention.

语言和身体接触帮助引导注意力。

But attention is the queen.

但注意力是女王。

There is nothing you can do with your arms that will replace this careful direction of attention, and no wardrobe error or girlish upspeak that can rob you of your power when you have mastered it. But just as the other person's animal body is affected by your state of attention, so, too, is your own.

你的手臂能做的任何事情都不能取代这种仔细的注意力引导，也没有任何服装错误或女孩式的上扬语调能在你掌握它时剥夺你的力量。但正如对方的动物身体受到你的注意力状态的影响，你自己也是如此。

When you train with The Jason, you are training to sustain your attention out powerfully, and for an extended period of time. Practice every time your Mistress group meets—get really good at it—and you won't ever get caught speechless; you'll learn to take up space, to naturally assume dominant body language, to signal your alpha status for the time that you are speaking, to speak to the body of your sub, to watch your words land with authority in his body.

当你用杰森训练时，你正在训练强大地、长时间地保持你的注意力向外。每次你的女主人小组聚会时练习——真正擅长它——你就永远不会被抓住无言；你将学会占据空间，自然地假设支配性的身体语言，在你说话的时候发出你的阿尔法状态信号，与你的顺从者的身体说话，看着你的话语以权威的方式落在他的身体上。

This is the dominant state. This exercise creates that state of attention, and sustains it.

这就是支配状态。这个练习创造那种注意力状态，并维持它。

Most of the time, the women I teach don't Freeze. They are the kind of powerful bitches who will holler back at a catcall, who can bat most inappropriate questions away like a bored cat.

大多数时候，我教的女性不会冻结。她们是那种会对口哨声回应的强大婊子，她们能像一只无聊的猫一样拍掉大多数不合适的问题。

But this is precisely what is so dangerous about the Freeze: a woman can be in her power 99 percent of her life, and then freeze during the 1 percent that counts the most. It's in these moments—the moment when she knows she doesn't trust the babysitter and doesn't feel safe to speak, the moment when the last person on earth she thought would turn out to be a creep turns into one—where the course of our lives can be decided.

但这正是冻结如此危险的原因：一个女人可以在她生活的99%时间里处于她的力量中，然后在最重要的1%时间里冻结。正是在这些时刻——她知道她不信任保姆并且感觉不安全说话的时刻，她认为世界上最不可能成为变态的人变成变态的时刻——我们生活的轨迹可以被决定。

These are the moments we train for.

这些是我们训练的时刻。

Which job you get, which relationship you commit to, where you live, even what you charge for your services—these are too important to be determined by a temporary incapacity. We always need to be able to flip the power dynamic so that we can buy ourselves a little time, because it's very difficult to change course once it's set. Once you've agreed to joint custody even though you know your ex has a drug problem, once you've stood silently by as an arms dealer was appointed to your board, once you've let one joke about "the diversity hire" slide—it's much harder to do something different, or make the change you want to see.

你得到什么工作，你承诺什么关系，你住在哪里，甚至你为你的服务收取什么——这些都太重要了，不能由暂时的无能来决定。我们总是需要能够翻转权力动态，这样我们可以为自己买一点时间，因为一旦设定，改变方向是非常困难的。一旦你同意了共同监护，即使你知道你的前夫有毒品问题，一旦你在军火商被任命为你的董事会成员时默默地站在一边，一旦你让一个关于"多样性招聘"的笑话滑过——做不同的事情，或做出你想看到的改变，要困难得多。

This is how the Freeze limits the influence of women, and it is what we are here to change. If you don't know how to say no—or how to play with someone's attention on you while you decide whether you want to say yes or no, then you are powerless. And powerlessness is not at all what I want for you.

这就是冻结如何限制女性的影响力，这就是我们在这里要改变的。如果你不知道如何说不——或者如何在决定你是否想说是或否时玩弄某人对你的注意力，那么你就是无力的。无力根本不是我想要的。

This biological hijack is nearly universal among women. Know that you are not alone—in the unwilling silence, or in the shame afterward. You are, however, the result of millennia of cultural conditioning. As you practice breaking the Freeze, you will not only be more free to speak in the most difficult moments, but recrafting a pattern that took thousands of years to imprint. It's powerful work.

这种生物劫持在女性中几乎是普遍的。知道你不孤单——在不愿意的沉默中，或在之后的羞耻中。然而，你是几千年文化条件作用的结果。当你练习打破冻结时，你不仅会在最困难的时刻更自由地说话，而且会重新塑造一个花费数千年才印制的模式。这是有力的工作。

Congratulations. You are now a graduate of the Verbal Self-Defense Dojo.

恭喜。你现在是口头自卫道场的毕业生。

There is much to celebrate, because what you've learned isn't just a self-defense tool or a way to manage the people in your life; it's a way to change the culture. We can make all the rules we want to; we can shake our fingers at people, and tell them how they should behave. But every one of us is training the people around us how we (and other women) want to be treated every minute, and nothing will ever be more powerful than giving the other humans in our lives feedback on what does and doesn't work for us.

有很多值得庆祝的事情，因为你学到的不仅仅是一种自卫工具或管理你生活中的人的方式；这是一种改变文化的方式。我们可以制定所有我们想要的规则；我们可以对人们摇手指，告诉他们应该如何表现。但我们每个人都在训练我们周围的人如何（和其他女性）想要被对待每一分钟，没有什么会比给我们生活中的其他人类关于什么对我们有效和无效的反馈更有力。

Sometimes a pitiless smack is exactly what's needed to stop the person from doing harm not only to you and other women but to themselves. Because what's harder to see is that this behavior also hurts the person doing it, whether they're aware of it or not.

有时，无情的打击正是阻止这个人不仅伤害你和其他女性，也伤害他们自己所需要的。因为更难看到的是，这种行为也伤害了这样做的人，无论他们是否意识到这一点。

Love often comes with big smiles and hugs, but love has many faces: in its simplest form, it is only and exactly the thing that is most needed. When your kid is running into traffic, do you stop and politely explain to them why playing in the street is dangerous? No—you yell to get their attention and yank them back to safety. Love is delivering what's required in order to bring a person into alignment with what's alive. It can look like a takedown, or a hug, or an Ask, or a question.

爱经常伴随着大大的微笑和拥抱，但爱有很多面孔：在最简单的形式中，它只是并且正是最需要的东西。当你的孩子跑到车流中时，你会停下来礼貌地向他们解释为什么在街上玩耍是危险的吗？不——你大喊以引起他们的注意，把他们拉回安全。爱是提供所需的，以便让一个人与活着的东西对齐。它可以看起来像击倒，或拥抱，或要求，或问题。

Love isn't nice; love is what's needed.

爱不是好的；爱是需要的。

Admittedly, not every asshole is someone to play with. But sometimes the people we need and want and care about having in our lives also act like assholes. You may decide that reeducating this particular idiot is not going to work with your calendar today, thank you very much. You may decide to stick around long enough to rip them a new one, or simply walk away.

诚然，不是每个混蛋都是可以一起玩的人。但有时我们需要和想要并关心拥有在我们生活中的人也表现得像混蛋。你可能决定今天重新教育这个特定的白痴不会与你的日程安排配合，非常感谢。你可能决定坚持足够长的时间来给他们一个新的，或者简单地走开。

Or you may continue with a softer touch in order to establish if there's a third narrative that the two of you can explore together, one that will be generative and productive and create intimacy and connection and allow for the possibility of the influence you seek.

或者你可以继续用更柔和的方式，以建立是否存在你们两个可以一起探索的第三种叙述，一种将是生成性和生产性的，创造亲密和连接，并允许你寻求的影响的可能性。

This is how real change happens, one human interaction at a time.

这就是真正改变发生的方式，一次一个人际互动。
