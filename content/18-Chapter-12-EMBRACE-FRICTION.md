# Chapter 12: EMBRACE FRICTION | 第十二章：拥抱摩擦

## The Power to Navigate Resistance | 应对阻力的力量

The truth: Nobody wants to resist.

真相：没有人想要抵抗。

It's uncomfortable. It doesn't feel good to say no; it feels much better to say yes, and to mean it. So people dig their heels in only when there is something very important that they're protecting.

这很不舒服。说"不"感觉不好；说"是"并认真对待它感觉好得多。所以人们只有在保护一些非常重要的东西时才会坚持到底。

This is why resistance is so tricky to play with—and why it's so very rewarding to hunt for the borders.

这就是为什么抵抗如此难以处理——以及为什么寻找边界如此有价值。

Other people's resistance is a rich source of information—and of potential connectedness.

其他人的抵抗是信息的丰富来源——也是潜在连接的来源。

Like so many things, I learned this in the dungeon. Do you have any idea how boring a dominance session is when there is no resistance?

就像很多事情一样，我在地牢里学到了这一点。你知道当没有抵抗时，支配会话是多么无聊吗？

It's excruciating.

这是痛苦的。

A man comes in; I tell him to kiss my feet. He does what I ask, perfectly. If there's no resistance, I have to find some—or invent it! Maybe I call his name and accuse him of turning his head too slowly, even though his head-turning happened at a completely normal rate. Otherwise, we're in for a long hour: instructions given, then dutifully, faultlessly carried out—a fully automated machine, no more interesting than a parking meter.

一个男人进来；我告诉他亲吻我的脚。他完美地做了我要求的事。如果没有抵抗，我必须找到一些——或者发明它！也许我叫他的名字，指责他转头太慢，即使他的转头速度完全正常。否则，我们将面临一个漫长的小时：给出指示，然后尽职尽责、毫无错误地执行——一个完全自动化的机器，不比停车计时器更有趣。

In a session without resistance, nothing happens between us. Nothing moves; nothing grows. Nothing is discovered; nothing is achieved. I might as well have dropped off a printed list of instructions and left the room.

在没有抵抗的会话中，我们之间什么也没有发生。没有移动；没有成长。没有发现；没有实现。我还不如留下一份打印的指示清单然后离开房间。

Now imagine a different version of the same scene. That same guy is at my feet. I issue my command but see a certain stubbornness in the set of his chin when he hears it. He's holding back: something's stuck, something's hidden.

现在想象同一场景的不同版本。同一个家伙在我脚边。我发出命令，但当他听到时，我看到他下巴的某种固执。他在退缩：有些东西卡住了，有些东西被隐藏了。

Suddenly, I've got something interesting to play with.

突然，我有了有趣的东西可以玩。

I start playing by putting attention on the resistance I've noticed, locating it: "Did my request frighten you? Are you embarrassed? Is that a difficult order for you to follow?" And then I chase whatever comes up.

我开始通过将注意力放在我注意到的抵抗上，定位它："我的请求吓到你了吗？你尴尬吗？这对你来说是一个困难的命令吗？"然后我追逐出现的任何东西。

When I do that, a whole new space to play in will open up, something brand-new in the room.

当我这样做时，一个全新的游戏空间将打开，房间里有全新的东西。

I started learning real and beautiful things about the other person in the room, just by watching how they followed my lead. These lines of inquiry would often go very deep, very fast. I'd call attention to a heaviness in a client's chest, a flutter of his eyelids, a contraction of the stomach, and all of a sudden, he would be experiencing and sharing feelings and desires that had been quiet for him for a long time—secret shames, ungrieved losses, a huge, trembling new hope.

我开始了解房间里另一个人的真实和美好的事情，仅仅通过观察他们如何跟随我的引导。这些询问线往往非常深入，非常快。我会注意客户胸部的沉重、眼皮的颤动、胃部的收缩，突然之间，他会体验和分享对他来说已经安静很久的感觉和欲望——秘密的羞耻、未哀悼的损失、巨大的、颤抖的新希望。

I might have been the lead, the one in charge, the mistress of ceremonies, but whatever he was bringing to the room that day became the story. We were creating something together. Sessions became psychological, creative, generative, collaborative, surprising—and meaningful, for both of us.

我可能是领导者，负责人，仪式的主持人，但他那天带到房间的任何东西都变成了故事。我们在一起创造东西。会话变得心理化、创造性、生成性、协作性、令人惊讶——对我们双方都有意义。

What I learned in the dungeon is true outside of it: resistance becomes a gift, beautiful to encounter, when we come to understand that it's really a neon arrow pointing straight at something of deep importance to the other person, whether it's their heart, their vanity, their shame, or painful questions about their rightful place.

我在地牢里学到的东西在外面也是真实的：当我们开始理解抵抗真的是一个霓虹箭头，直指对另一个人来说深刻重要的东西——无论是他们的心、他们的虚荣、他们的羞耻，还是关于他们正当地位的痛苦问题——时，抵抗就变成了一份礼物，美丽地遇见。

This is what makes connecting with it the greatest fuel, and not just for the next negotiation, but for collaborating on truly transcendent solutions. Because if you play well in places you're not sure you have permission to go, you'll discover resources you didn't know were available.

这就是使与它连接成为最大燃料的原因，不仅是为了下一次谈判，也是为了在真正超越的解决方案上合作。因为如果你在你不确定是否有权去的地方玩得好，你会发现你不知道可用的资源。

Of course, an individual's expressed wishes are paramount, everywhere and always. This isn't a guide to brutally steamrolling over what another person wants or needs. Even in a sadomasochistic session, if you're "punishing" someone, it works only if you do it just right; you want to wake them up, but if you go too fast or too loud or too hard, their bodies will shut down. That's what a tyrant does—the ultimate bad domme.

当然，个人表达的愿望是最重要的，无论在哪里，无论何时。这不是残忍地碾压另一个人想要或需要的指南。即使在虐恋会话中，如果你在"惩罚"某人，只有你做得恰到好处才会有效；你想唤醒他们，但如果你太快、太大声或太用力，他们的身体会关闭。这就是暴君所做的——终极坏女支配者。

And yet, if there is no conflict, or if we fail to engage with the conflict that naturally arises, there is no energy in the relationship, no movement—no life.

然而，如果没有冲突，或者如果我们未能参与自然产生的冲突，关系中就没有能量，没有运动——没有生命。

More often than not, Ruben and I have found that the kind of active cocreation that happens when two people work through resistance together gives rise to something more than was previously possible. What we've seen, over and over again, is that two people together creating options out of the crucible of resistance will often do something better than simply getting to yes. They will come up with a third solution, one that wildly outperforms both of their expectations—and one that would have been previously unthinkable before the conflict arose, simply because nobody was looking there.

大多数情况下，鲁本和我发现，当两个人一起通过抵抗工作时发生的主动共同创造会产生比以前可能的东西更多的东西。我们一次又一次看到的是，两个人一起从抵抗的熔炉中创造选项，往往会做一些比简单地说"是"更好的事情。他们会想出一个第三种解决方案，一个远远超出他们双方期望的解决方案——一个在冲突出现之前以前无法想象的解决方案，仅仅因为没有人在那里看。

In The Academy, we have seen over and over that these Difficult Asks don't harm relationships, as women are so often afraid that they will, but instead strengthen them by giving air and light to a crucial but previously unspoken desire. Having the courage, the love, and the power to be able to speak about these difficult topics is not only the gateway to tremendous influence, it's where connectedness begins. And so many times, I've seen how the solutions the partners arrive at satisfy an unspoken need, not just for the person asking, but for both of them.

在学院（The Academy），我们一次又一次看到这些困难的要求（Difficult Asks）不会伤害关系，就像女性经常害怕的那样，而是通过给关键但以前未说出的欲望带来空气和光明来加强它们。拥有勇气、爱和权力能够谈论这些困难的话题不仅是通往巨大影响力的门户，也是连接开始的地方。很多时候，我看到了伙伴们达成的解决方案如何满足未说出的需求，不仅对提问的人，而且对双方都是如此。

What follows is a template for skillfully managing resistance in another person. In the real world, of course, there's no tried-and-true blueprint—every person's resistance will manifest differently, and every development will require a different move in response. Patience will be required. But progress will come if you return—and keep returning—to these fundamentals.

接下来是一个巧妙地管理他人抵抗的模板。当然，在现实世界中，没有经过验证的蓝图——每个人的抵抗都会以不同的方式表现出来，每个发展都需要不同的回应举措。需要耐心。但如果你回到——并不断回到——这些基本原则，进步就会到来。

### Keep Your Attention Out | 保持注意力在外

In order to deal with someone else's resistance, you have to be able to keep your attention out.

为了处理他人的抵抗，你必须能够保持注意力在外。

Not all the time, of course—you need to be able to check in with yourself, to gauge how the responses you're getting are sitting with you. Nor does this mean that you cannot make a submissive-style Ask. But moving someone through their resistance requires sensing and testing, and that means attention out.

当然，不是一直——你需要能够检查自己，评估你得到的响应如何与你相处。这也不意味着你不能做顺从风格的要求。但帮助某人通过他们的抵抗需要感知和测试，这意味着注意力在外。

Let's backtrack for a second. When someone says no, you've encountered resistance. Men are all too aware that hearing no can be very painful for women—which is why a lot of them won't say it at all. They find other, less direct ways to resist. For example: he'll agree to your Ask, but without passion or conviction, so you leave the encounter with the uneasy feeling that you lost him somewhere along the line, even though you technically got a yes. He might go on the offensive, attacking your logic or your right to make the request at all. He might strike for the jugular, delivering a devastatingly hurtful insult designed to shut you down. Or he might withdraw into himself, stone-facedly serving up monosyllabic answers to your requests instead of the spirited debate you came prepared for.

让我们回溯一下。当某人说"不"时，你遇到了抵抗。男人非常清楚听到"不"对女人来说可能非常痛苦——这就是为什么很多人根本不会说它。他们找到其他、不那么直接的方式来抵抗。例如：他会同意你的要求，但没有热情或信念，所以你离开这次遭遇时有一种不安的感觉，你在某处失去了他，即使从技术上讲你得到了一个"是"。他可能会进攻，攻击你的逻辑或你提出请求的权利。他可能会打击要害，发出旨在让你闭嘴的毁灭性伤害性侮辱。或者他可能会退缩到自己里面，面无表情地为你的请求提供单音节的答案，而不是你准备好的激烈辩论。

These are all forms of resistance, and you can play with all of them. But this is why your attention must be out. Because when we're talking about resistance, we're talking not just about what someone consciously does, but where they're at.

这些都是抵抗的形式，你可以与它们一起玩。但这就是为什么你的注意力必须在外。因为当我们谈论抵抗时，我们不仅谈论某人有意做的事情，还谈论他们在哪里。

If you get stuck with your attention turned inward, then you've lost the other person entirely. The feeling they get, when you recoil in response to their no, is that you've dropped them energetically. Their no injured you—and now they don't feel like it's safe to tell you the truth.

如果你的注意力转向内部，那么你就完全失去了另一个人。当你因为他们的"不"而退缩时，他们得到的感觉是你已经在能量上放弃了他们。他们的"不"伤害了你——现在他们觉得告诉你真相不安全。

And this is a very vulnerable moment in which to drop them. Imagine you're the one saying no. Wouldn't it be wonderful to feel that, after you said no, the other person expressed an interest and a respect for and a curiosity about exactly the thing you're trying to protect? What if you felt the possibility that they were willing to invest in protecting it?

这是一个非常脆弱的时刻来放弃他们。想象你是说"不"的那个人。如果你说了"不"之后，另一个人表达了对你试图保护的东西的兴趣、尊重和好奇心，那不是很棒吗？如果你感到他们愿意投资保护它的可能性呢？

This is why it's so important to train to overcome the body's contraction in response to no, and to keep your attention out after you hear it. Get curious about this thing they value. Showing that you take it into consideration is one of the main things that differentiates powerful influence from tyrannical control.

这就是为什么训练克服身体对"不"的收缩并在听到它后保持注意力在外如此重要。对他们重视的东西感到好奇。表明你考虑到它是区分强大影响力和暴虐控制的主要事情之一。

### Locate, Approve, Influence | 定位、批准、影响

You already know that you've stumbled onto something important—the other person's resistance tells you so. But influence comes only when you have established exactly what it is about the request you've made that's earned this reaction.

你已经知道你撞上了重要的东西——另一个人的抵抗告诉了你这一点。但只有当你确切确定了你的请求中引起这种反应的内容时，影响才会到来。

What is the other person protecting? What are their concerns? What do they care about? What are they passionate about? What would your plan expose? What are they hiding? What are they afraid of?

另一个人在保护什么？他们的关切是什么？他们在乎什么？他们对什么充满热情？你的计划会暴露什么？他们在隐藏什么？他们害怕什么？

about it.

关于它。

Effectively working with someone else's resistance is more than making a really good case or a bulletproof argument. It's about creating a whole experience for the other person—one that they may not even be aware of.

有效地处理他人的抵抗不仅仅是做一个真正好的案例或一个防弹的论证。这是为另一个人创造一个完整的体验——一个他们甚至可能没有意识到的体验。

So: with your attention out (at least at first), your curiosity on alert, and a gentle touch (go slow—impatience is generally a lack of confidence!), you'll locate the other person's resistance, approve of it—and then influence the other person, asking, "How do I use this information to inspire and motivate and excite you, so that we're creating this next adventure together?"

所以：你的注意力在外（至少最初），你的好奇心处于警戒状态，轻柔的触碰（慢慢来——不耐烦通常是缺乏自信！），你会定位另一个人的抵抗，批准它——然后影响另一个人，问："我如何使用这些信息来激励和激励和兴奋你，这样我们在一起创造下一个冒险？"

To be clear: This is not a neat process, but rather steps in a sequence that you will return to, over and over, until you have moved closer to the result you desire. In long-term relationships, or over a particularly intractable issue, you might return to the same disagreement a number of times. Then again, a major conflict can sometimes be entirely resolved in the location step.

要清楚：这不是一个整洁的过程，而是一个序列中的步骤，你会一次又一次地返回，直到你更接近你渴望的结果。在长期关系中，或者在一个特别棘手的问题上，你可能会多次回到同一个分歧。同样，一个重大冲突有时可以在定位步骤中完全解决。

But if you keep returning to these steps—locate, approve, influence (and I'm going to say them so many times you're going to be sick of reading them)—then you finally avoid the trap that derails too many relationships: having the same fight over and over again. Almost always, that's a function of skipping one of these crucial steps.

但如果你不断回到这些步骤——定位、批准、影响（我会说这么多遍，你会厌倦阅读它们）——那么你最终会避免让太多关系出轨的陷阱：一次又一次地进行同样的战斗。几乎总是，这是跳过这些关键步骤之一的功能。

Bear in mind: The way we deal with resistance in others often mirrors how we deal with resistance in ourselves. Women who are conflict-avoidant and who back away from the things that they want (often by saying that they have no self-discipline) may repeat that evasion in their relationships. And women who will gut it out no matter what, who will push on and force themselves through their own resistance long after they've lost connection with the life of the project, will very often do the same thing when they fight. Stay mindful of your tendency as we take these next steps.

记住：我们处理他人抵抗的方式往往反映了我们如何处理自己内心的抵抗。避免冲突的女性，以及从她们想要的东西后退的女性（经常说她们没有自律）可能会在她们的关系中重复这种逃避。而那些无论如何都会坚持下去的女性，那些在她们与项目生命失去联系很久之后仍会推动并强迫自己通过自己抵抗的女性，在她们战斗时经常会做同样的事情。在我们采取这些下一步时，保持对你倾向的意识。

The first step toward influence, after getting legitimate about your request, is to locate the person. You will do this by asking the person a series of questions about the circumstances that led to their no, and watching their responses—not just what they say, but what happens in their bodies.

在获得你的请求的正当性之后，影响的第一步是定位这个人。你将通过询问这个人一系列关于导致他们说"不"的情况的问题，并观察他们的反应——不仅仅是他们说的，还有他们身体中发生的事情。

Asking "Why not?" in response to a no or other manifestation of resistance will feel to the other person like an attack. (Which is why it's so often met with a responding slap: "Because I said so.") A true effort to locate the other person, like "How did it make you feel when I asked you that?" is more likely to yield a response. Your goal is not (yet) to figure out what's bothering them about the scenario you're proposing, but to help them to label where they are, what's coming up for them in that moment, and how they're doing.

问"为什么不？"作为对"不"或其他抵抗表现的回应，对另一个人来说会感觉像是攻击。（这就是为什么它经常遇到回应的一击："因为我说了算。"）真正定位另一个人的努力，比如"当我问你那个时，它让你感觉如何？"更有可能产生回应。你的目标不是（还）找出你提出的场景中困扰他们的是什么，而是帮助他们标记他们在哪里，那一刻对他们来说发生了什么，以及他们的状态。

Or you can name your perception of the other person's state, and then confirm it. "You seem a little shocked that I'd ask to move to a four-day workweek. Is that true?" "You seem irritated by the statement that we need more secretarial-type support. Is that true?" "You seem dismissive of this alternative drug protocol I found in the course of my research. Is that true?"

或者你可以说出你对另一个人状态的感知，然后确认它。"你似乎对我要求改为四天工作周感到有点震惊。这是真的吗？" "你似乎对我们需要更多秘书类型支持的声明感到恼火。这是真的吗？" "你似乎对我研究过程中发现的这种替代药物方案不屑一顾。这是真的吗？"

Locating the other person may take a couple of tries, especially if big feelings are involved. Stay connected. Take the time you need to feel yourself—and the other person. The minute you lose embodiment, this becomes just another shitty fight—a reaction to a reaction to a reaction. Speed past your feeling sense and you are flying blind.

定位另一个人可能需要几次尝试，特别是如果涉及大情绪。保持连接。花时间你需要感受自己——和另一个人。你失去体现的那一刻，这就变成了另一场糟糕的战斗——对反应的反应的反应。速度超过你的感觉，你就在盲目飞行。

You control the pace. Never move faster than you can feel.

你控制节奏。永远不要移动得比你感觉到的快。

Let's look at this in context. I'm deliberately using a fantastical example here to demonstrate that it doesn't matter what the conflict is about. You might be asking your boss to expand your role, or asking your husband to consider opening your marriage or to have another child. It could be a weighty, freighted conflict between siblings about a property you've inherited jointly, or one with much lower stakes (even though it may not feel like it!), such as asking your roommate to do their own damn dishes. The circumstances will change; the sense of curiosity and playfulness you bring to the conflict should not. And in every instance, your success will be dependent on your ability to keep your attention out.

让我们在上下文中看看这个。我故意在这里使用一个幻想的例子来证明冲突是关于什么并不重要。你可能在要求你的老板扩大你的角色，或者要求你的丈夫考虑开放你的婚姻或生另一个孩子。这可能是兄弟姐妹之间关于你共同继承的财产的沉重、充满负担的冲突，或者是一个赌注低得多的冲突（即使它可能感觉不像！），比如要求你的室友洗他们自己的该死的盘子。情况会改变；你带给冲突的好奇心和嬉戏感不应该改变。在每种情况下，你的成功将取决于你保持注意力在外的能力。

So let's look at what happens when Abby tells her husband, Emilio, that she's interested in purchasing a unicorn farm.

所以让我们看看当阿比告诉她的丈夫埃米利奥，她对购买独角兽农场感兴趣时会发生什么。

In one scenario, Emilio immediately flies off the handle. "What are you talking about? You want us to have unicorns? I thought we were committed to raising dragons!"

在一个场景中，埃米利奥立即大发雷霆。"你在说什么？你想要我们有独角兽？我以为我们致力于养龙！"

Abby makes a first attempt to locate him: "It seems like you're pretty angry."

阿比第一次尝试定位他："你似乎很生气。"

"I'm not angry!"

"我不生气！"

"Okay. Is it fair to say that you're upset?"

"好的。说你很沮丧公平吗？"

"Of course I'm upset! You want to throw everything we've worked for in the trash!"

"我当然很沮丧！你想把我们努力的一切都扔进垃圾桶！"

Congratulations to Abby! Although her husband is still quite upset, she has located him—and she can tell because he's started to divulge valuable information about the nature of his resistance, revealing that he automatically equates Abby's desire for a unicorn farm with a desire to throw their dragon hatchery away.

恭喜阿比！虽然她的丈夫仍然很沮丧，但她已经定位了他——她可以判断，因为他开始透露关于他抵抗本质的有价值信息，揭示了他自动将阿比对独角兽农场的欲望等同于想要扔掉他们的龙孵化场。

Even though Abby knows she's not throwing their dragons away, she moves to approving of the state her husband is in. Remember: Just as with ourselves, approving of a state does not mean condoning it. It simply means acknowledging what is actually happening, as opposed to what you wish was happening.

尽管阿比知道她没有扔掉他们的龙，但她开始批准她丈夫的状态。记住：就像我们自己一样，批准一种状态并不意味着宽恕它。它只是意味着承认实际正在发生的事情，而不是你希望发生的事情。

Approving means getting aligned with what is.

批准意味着与实际情况对齐。

So if your boss is being a jerk just because you've mentioned receiving another offer in a salary negotiation, then approving of her might sound something like "Hey! You're being a real jerk right now! I understand why: you thought I was looking to jump to another company after you'd invested a lot of time and energy in training me, and you probably felt taken advantage of."

所以如果你的老板只是因为你在薪资谈判中提到收到另一个报价而表现得像个混蛋，那么批准她可能听起来像"嘿！你现在真的是个混蛋！我理解为什么：你认为在你投入大量时间和精力培训我之后，我正在寻找跳槽到另一家公司，你可能感到被利用了。"

Abby can combine approval with location: "You're upset because you think that I'm throwing our dragons away. I love that you're so passionate about our hatchery. But I've given this a lot of thought, and I think this is how we deepen our commitment to magical creatures, not end it."

阿比可以将批准与定位结合起来："你很沮丧，因为你认为我正在扔掉我们的龙。我喜欢你对我们的孵化场如此热情。但我已经仔细考虑过这个，我认为这是我们加深对神奇生物承诺的方式，而不是结束它。"

Approval is a very powerful move. Logically, it should move the fight into a more incendiary place—you're poking the other person right where they're trying to hide. And yet we often find that the opposite happens: simply seeing the person and acknowledging where they're at defuses the situation instead.

批准是一个非常强大的举动。逻辑上，它应该将战斗移动到一个更具煽动性的地方——你正在戳另一个人试图隐藏的地方。然而，我们经常发现相反的情况发生：简单地看到这个人并承认他们的位置反而缓和了局势。

Approval certainly does not mean that you permanently accept the state the other person is in, or are resigned to living with it; in fact, it's usually helpful in being able to move them to a different one. If you yell, "You're not actually mad about this! You have no right to be mad about this!" at someone who is angry, you're gaslighting them, telling them they're not feeling what they're feeling. And even if you succeed in getting what you want, it will be through shame or intimidation, not influence.

批准当然不意味着你永久接受另一个人所处的状态，或屈服于与之共存；事实上，它通常有助于能够将他们移动到不同的状态。如果你对愤怒的人大喊："你实际上并不对此生气！你无权对此生气！"你正在对他们进行煤气灯操控，告诉他们他们不是感觉到他们在感觉的。即使你成功得到你想要的东西，也将是通过羞耻或恐吓，而不是影响。

Skipping the approval step—refusing to acknowledge where someone is, rather than where you want them to be—is often why people get stuck having a version of the same fight over and over; the other person will keep dragging you back to the scene of the crime until you see them where they are. But if you really get to the core of someone's resistance and connect with it, then you're actually going to get somewhere.

跳过批准步骤——拒绝承认某人在哪里，而不是你想要他们在哪里——通常是为什么人们陷入一次又一次进行同一场战斗的版本；另一个人会不断把你拖回犯罪现场，直到你看到他们在哪里。但如果你真的到达某人抵抗的核心并与之连接，那么你实际上会有所进展。

Never be afraid to locate something that already exists. When I work with women, I say, "Use everything"—every vice, every bit of ugly, every source of shame that arises. Everything that has the power to be negative also contains within it the power to be positive. Witness it, and invite it back in; find a place for it that transforms its essential qualities into something positive, creating expansion and light and heat so that you can then direct that energy creatively.

永远不要害怕定位已经存在的东西。当我和女性一起工作时，我说，"使用一切"——每一个恶习，每一个丑陋的部分，每一个出现的羞耻来源。每一个具有负面力量的东西也包含在其中成为正面的力量。见证它，并邀请它回来；为它找到一个地方，将其本质品质转化为积极的东西，创造扩展和光和热，这样你就可以创造性地引导那种能量。

This is true emotional alchemy—a concept I personally came to a deeper understanding of thanks to a guy with a very, very small dick.

这是真正的情感炼金术——我个人通过一个阴茎非常非常小的男人对这个概念有了更深的理解。

I had been working as a dominatrix for about two years, and had skyrocketed to great success. The same outward-turned attention that I used when practicing Chinese medicine and evading my sparring partner's hand before it connected with my cheek served me well in the dungeon; I could read my clients' bodies with precision, and use what I saw to guide the sessions in ways that were deep and profound.

我担任女支配者大约两年，并且取得了巨大成功。我在练习中医和躲避我的陪练伙伴的手之前使用的那种向外转的注意力在地牢里很好地为我服务；我可以精确地阅读客户的身体，并使用我看到的东西以深刻和深远的方式指导会话。

I hadn't expected to provide transcendence at the sex-work job I'd taken to pay the bills, but as my reputation for delivering those experiences grew, so did my client list. So I was ultraconfident and at the very top of my game when I walked into my session with Mark—until he undressed, and I saw his micropenis.

我没有期望在我为了支付账单而从事的性工作中提供超越，但随着我提供这些体验的声誉增长，我的客户名单也增加了。所以当我走进与马克的会话时，我超级自信，处于我的巅峰状态——直到他脱掉衣服，我看到了他的小阴茎。

I hadn't encountered one before, and it shocked me. Nor was I used to feeling pity for my clients, who tended to be master-of-the-universe types. I recovered, and the session went fine—except that I wasn't used to settling for "fine." I hated feeling like I was just going through the motions, performing for him like I was there to punch a clock.

我以前从未遇到过，它震惊了我。我也不习惯于对我的客户感到同情，他们往往是宇宙大师类型。我恢复了，会话进行得不错——除了我不习惯满足于"不错"。我讨厌感觉自己只是在走过场，为他表演，就像我在那里打卡一样。

Which is why, forty minutes in and frustrated, I called Mark pinkie dick.

这就是为什么，四十分钟后，我感到沮丧，我称马克为小指阴茎。

We made eye contact then, and a wave of shame—his, mine, society's—rose up into the room. I knew immediately that it would crash down and drown us if I couldn't find a way to lean into what I'd just said. So I kept going: "You can't fuck a woman with that dick. You can't fuck anything! I bet you've had to spend your entire life figuring out different and twisted ways to get off. You must be a magician of deviant sexuality—a Prince of Perversion. The King of Kink! In fact, I bet you could teach a whole course on hot, alternative sex. I bet you could school me."

然后我们进行了眼神交流，一波羞耻——他的、我的、社会的——涌入了房间。我立即知道，如果我不能找到一种方法来依靠我刚刚说的话，它会崩溃并淹没我们。所以我继续说："你不能用那个阴茎操女人。你什么也操不了！我敢打赌你不得不花一生时间想出不同和扭曲的方式来达到高潮。你一定是变态性行为的魔术师——变态王子。恋物之王！事实上，我敢打赌你可以教授一整门关于火热的另类性行为的课程。我敢打赌你可以教我。"

That was when the whole room lit up. By connecting through the discomfort, I had located Mark's deepest shame and approved of it, and suddenly the two of us were at the center of a vortex of energy, digested and transformed. It turned out to be one of the most brilliant sessions I did in my entire career.

那就是整个房间亮起来的时候。通过连接不适，我定位了马克最深的羞耻并批准了它，突然我们两人处于能量漩涡的中心，被消化和转化。结果证明这是我整个职业生涯中做过的最精彩的会话之一。

It's exciting to look at someone and recognize that there's something hidden. And it's a rare person who thinks, "There's something held back there. I am going to put my attention on it, and use my imagination and sense and test and play until something moves," knowing that when it does, everyone will be nourished because the release will provide light and heat and imagination and juice—passionate fuel for everybody involved.

看着某人并认识到有隐藏的东西是令人兴奋的。而很少有人会想，"那里有被抑制的东西。我要把注意力放在它上面，使用我的想象力和感觉以及测试和游戏，直到有什么移动，"知道当它发生时，每个人都会被滋养，因为释放将提供光和热以及想象力和汁液——为所有相关人员提供激情的燃料。

This, of course, is influence.

这，当然，就是影响。

### Achieving Influence: Follow What's Alive | 实现影响：跟随什么活着

With location and approval, you are using your attention to determine what is trapped and needs to move in another person. You can then ask: "What's needed? What's the next thing that needs to be clarified or felt? Where's the energy, the heat, the life? And what will move us into a different—more exciting, more collaborative—place?"

通过定位和批准，你正在使用你的注意力来确定什么被困住并需要在另一个人中移动。然后你可以问："需要什么？下一个需要澄清或感受的事情是什么？能量、热量、生命在哪里？什么将把我们移动到一个不同的——更令人兴奋、更协作的——地方？"

Remember: Every Ask is an invitation to play, and to relate in a new way. So stay attentive to the hot spots.

记住：每一个要求都是游戏的邀请，以及以新方式关联。所以保持对热点的关注。

This may take a little practice, especially if you're someone who traditionally moves away from conflict, but it may also be the most important concept in this book.

这可能需要一点练习，特别是如果你是一个传统上远离冲突的人，但它也可能是这本书中最重要的概念。

Another way to think about influence is moving the other person from what he's fighting against to what he's fighting for. We've talked about fighting against/fighting for in the context of discovering our own passions; here, we use the same framework to think about playing with resistance in another person. This is why engagement with resistance isn't just a way of getting what you want, but a gift you give to the other person: you are discovering things about the other person that they don't even know about themselves.

思考影响的另一种方式是将另一个人从他反对的东西移动到他为它战斗的东西。我们在发现我们自己激情的背景下谈论了反对/为了战斗；在这里，我们使用相同的框架来思考与另一个人的抵抗游戏。这就是为什么参与抵抗不仅仅是你得到你想要的东西的方式，而且是你给另一个人的礼物：你正在发现关于另一个人的事情，他们甚至不知道自己。

Abby's husband may sound like he's fighting against the possibility of the two of them raising unicorns, but what he's really doing is fighting for their dragons. She needs to show him, through the Asks she makes and the commands she gives, that she is doing the same thing. She'll do that by locating him and approving of what's going on with him—and by proposing a solution: for the two of them to deepen their relationship with magical creatures and the strength of their connection to that world by embarking on some glorious and exciting new adventures together.

阿比的丈夫听起来像是在反对他们两人养独角兽的可能性，但他真正在做的是为他们的龙而战。她需要通过她提出的要求和命令向他展示，她也在做同样的事情。她将通过定位他并批准他正在发生的事情——并提出一个解决方案：通过一起开始一些光荣和令人兴奋的新冒险，让他们两人加深与神奇生物的关系以及他们与那个世界的联系的力量。

Influence isn't ordinarily achieved with a single Ask; it almost always involves a series of incremental steps, an organic series of moves that will differ in every situation. But I guarantee: if you return to locating and approving with every shift, the next step toward influence will be apparent, because you'll be connecting so deeply with the other person that the experience itself will start to lead.

影响通常不是通过单一要求实现的；它几乎总是涉及一系列增量步骤，一个有机的行动序列，在每个情况下都会有所不同。但我保证：如果你在每次转变时都回到定位和批准，那么朝着影响的下一步将是显而易见的，因为你将与另一个人连接得如此深入，以至于体验本身将开始引导。

Because it's so very rarely a straight line from location to influence, Ruben and I often stage fights in our classes so that students see what it looks and feels like to move someone through this state. This tends to be very effective, in part because Ruben happens to be fantastically, devilishly, infuriatingly good at serving up some typical forms of male resistance.

因为从定位到影响很少是一条直线，鲁本和我经常在我们的课堂上上演战斗，以便学生看到将某人通过这种状态看起来和感觉如何。这往往非常有效，部分是因为鲁本恰好非常出色、令人发狂地擅长提供一些典型的男性抵抗形式。

People are very good at protecting their secret fears, their deepest worries, and their shame. So Emilio is most likely not going to come straight out and say to Abby: "I'm not secure enough in my masculinity to become The Unicorn Guy." Chances are, he's going to find another way to make an end run around the conversation.

人们非常擅长保护他们秘密的恐惧、他们最深的担忧和他们的羞耻。所以埃米利奥最不可能直接对阿比说："我对我的男子气概不够自信，无法成为独角兽家伙。"很可能，他会找到另一种方法来绕过对话。

He might, for instance, invoke a third party: "A wife should . . ." or "The Church says . . ." or "Everyone says unicorns are . . ." Of course, there are only two people in a dynamic. When someone starts dragging a study or an institution into the conversation, it generally signals a deflection.

例如，他可能会援引第三方："妻子应该......"或"教会说......"或"每个人都说独角兽是......"当然，在动态中只有两个人。当有人开始将研究或机构拖入对话时，这通常表示转移。

He might fundamentally delegitimize her request: "You've been under a lot of stress recently, and we both know how you get around your birthday; I think you're letting your emotions get the better of you right now. Unicorns aren't going to solve your midlife crisis. You're not clearly seeing the risks." Oooh! Paternalistic and condescending—infuriating!

他可能从根本上剥夺她请求的合法性："你最近压力很大，我们都知道你生日前后会怎样；我认为你现在让你的情绪控制了你。独角兽不会解决你的中年危机。你没有清楚地看到风险。"哦！家长式和居高临下——令人愤怒！

Emilio might try to gaslight her by telling her she doesn't really want what she wants: "You don't really want to get involved with unicorns; you're only thinking about this because of those influencers on Instagram." Even if that's true, Abby has taken my class, and knows she has no say in what she wants. Emilio telling her she isn't feeling what she's feeling isn't going to return the "I want a unicorn" genie to the bottle.

埃米利奥可能会试图对她进行煤气灯操控，告诉她她并不是真的想要她想要的："你并不是真的想参与独角兽；你只是因为Instagram上的那些影响者才想到这个。"即使这是真的，阿比已经上了我的课，知道她对自己想要什么没有发言权。埃米利奥告诉她她没有感觉到她正在感觉的，不会把"我想要独角兽"的精灵放回瓶子里。

Or Emilio might try to switch sandboxes, which is our shorthand for hijacking a request or turning a conversation so that it centers on something more comfortable for the hijacker: "Of course dragon farming has started to feel unsexy, given that I'm exhausted, working night and day to support your shoe habit! Do you have any idea how much your credit card bill was last month?" If Abby's not careful, they're going to end up talking about her spending habits—which might be absolutely fine and appropriate at another date, but is miles away from the conversation she initiated about beginning to raise unicorns.

或者埃米利奥可能会尝试切换沙箱，这是我们劫持请求或转变对话的简写，使其集中在劫持者更舒适的事情上："当然养龙开始感觉不性感了，考虑到我精疲力尽，日夜工作来支持你的鞋子习惯！你知道你上个月的信用卡账单是多少吗？"如果阿比不小心，他们最终会谈论她的消费习惯——这在另一个日期可能是完全可以和适当的，但距离她发起的关于开始养独角兽的对话相去甚远。

Hurt and ashamed and angry, Emilio might come after Abby with a threat: "If you keep talking about unicorns, you're going to find yourself without a husband." Or he might reach for the death-ray option, designed to humiliate and shut his wife right down. "Nobody takes you seriously now. How do you think they're going to respond when they see you on a unicorn?" Killer comments like these can be a very effective way to cancel the conversation (woman exits stage right, weeping), unless Abby keeps her wits about her and remembers what she's trying to achieve.

受伤、羞耻和愤怒，埃米利奥可能会用威胁来对付阿比："如果你继续谈论独角兽，你会发现自己没有丈夫。"或者他可能会选择死亡射线选项，旨在羞辱并立即关闭他的妻子。"现在没有人认真对待你。你认为当他们看到你在独角兽上时会如何回应？"像这样的致命评论可能是取消对话的非常有效的方法（女人退出舞台右侧，哭泣），除非阿比保持清醒并记住她正在努力实现的目标。

(A note: Every one of us has said something absolutely heinous during an argument, and it's usually not grounds for divorce. That said, I don't countenance abuse; if threats and humiliation are par for the course in their marriage, Abby might want to think about ending it, instead of adding a bunch of unicorns to the mix.)

（注意：我们每个人在争论中都说过一些绝对可恶的话，这通常不是离婚的理由。也就是说，我不纵容虐待；如果威胁和羞辱在他们的婚姻中是常态，阿比可能想要考虑结束它，而不是在混合物中添加一堆独角兽。）

Or Emilio might shut the conversation down by powering down himself: "Absolutely not. This is not open for discussion, now—or ever. I'm going out; I need to be alone now." One way to end a game of tug-of-war is to drop your end of the rope.

或者埃米利奥可能会通过关闭自己来关闭对话："绝对不行。这不是讨论，现在——或永远。我要出去；我现在需要一个人。"结束拔河游戏的一种方法是放下你的绳子末端。

This isn't intended to be an exhaustive list of the many, many ways that people have of shielding their pain and shame, but I bet many of these are familiar to you from conflicts you've weathered in the past. (There's also cross-examination: "But you just said five minutes ago that you wanted more time for leisure, and now you're saying you want to start a whole new unicorn business?" Or what Ruben and I call "the sub-off," where both parties make exhaustive lists of how much they've sacrificed for the other person: "I can't believe you'd come for me with this unicorn garbage after I've worked a seventy-hour week at a job you know I hate, just to keep you and the dragons in the fancy house you couldn't live without. . . ." And there are hundreds more.)

这并不是要成为人们屏蔽痛苦和羞耻的许多、许多方式的详尽列表，但我敢打赌，其中许多是你从过去经历过的冲突中熟悉的。（还有交叉询问："但你刚才说五分钟前你想要更多休闲时间，现在你说你想要开始一个全新的独角兽生意？"或者鲁本和我称之为"顺从退出"的东西，双方都详细列出了他们为另一个人牺牲了多少："我不敢相信你会在我在一份你知道我讨厌的工作上工作了七十小时后用这个独角兽垃圾来找我，只是为了让你和龙留在你无法没有的豪华房子里......"还有数百种更多。）

But it doesn't really matter what Emilio does in the name of the resistance he's feeling—what matters is Abby's ability to get to what's behind it. There are a million different reasons that a man might feel fear or shame or trepidation when his wife suggests that they adopt a few new legendary creatures. If Abby really wants to get him on board with the plan, then she needs to figure out what Emilio's specific resistance to her proposition is, using location and approval to get him to say more. Is Emilio worried that she's saying that the hatchery is boring? Is he concerned that her dissatisfaction with their dragons really means she's tired of him?

但埃米利奥以他感觉到的抵抗的名义做什么并不重要——重要的是阿比到达它背后的能力。当他的妻子建议他们采用一些新的传奇生物时，男人可能感到恐惧或羞耻或恐惧的原因有一百万种不同。如果阿比真的想让他加入这个计划，那么她需要找出埃米利奥对她的提议的特定抵抗是什么，使用定位和批准让他说更多。埃米利奥是否担心她在说孵化场很无聊？他是否担心她对他们的龙的不满真的意味着她厌倦了他？

And then she needs to use what she's learned to influence him.

然后她需要使用她学到的东西来影响他。

So, just as Ruben and I would in class, let's go through some possible responses that Abby might use to guide Emilio through his resistance. (As good as Ruben is at throwing up resistance, I am even better at parrying it. . . .)

所以，就像鲁本和我在课堂上会做的那样，让我们看看阿比可能用来引导埃米利奥通过他的抵抗的一些可能的回应。（鲁本在抛出抵抗方面很好，我在回避它方面更好......）

Let's say Emilio invokes a third party by yelling about their peer group: "Normal people don't do this! How am I supposed to explain it when my buddies start giving me shit about my sparkly, horned horse?" Abby can start by locating him: "It seems like you're worried about what other people are going to think; is that right?" and then approving of what she's located: "I totally understand why you'd be scared that other people are going to think you're less of a man because we raise unicorns." Then she moves to influence: "But can you also imagine how your friends are going to feel when your never-been-done-before business idea takes off, and you're laughing all the way to the bank?"

假设埃米利奥通过大喊他们的同辈群体来援引第三方："正常人不会这样做！当我的伙伴开始因为我的闪亮、有角的马而嘲笑我时，我应该如何解释？"阿比可以通过定位他开始："你似乎担心其他人会怎么想；是这样吗？"然后批准她定位到的："我完全理解为什么你害怕其他人会认为因为我们养独角兽，你就不够男人。"然后她转向影响："但你能想象当你的前所未有的商业想法起飞，你一路笑着去银行时，你的朋友会感觉如何吗？"

If he gaslights her, trying to tell her that she doesn't actually want what she wants, she locates his skepticism and neutralizes it: "You don't want to believe that this desire is mine. But I want this. I want this for me; I want this for us. I want you with me; I want us to do this together. This isn't about Instagram; it's about us." (This is a great example of why it's important to do the Legitimacy exercise before a Difficult Ask; the more legible Abby is to Emilio, the more effective this will be. This is also an excellent example of a submissive-style Ask.) Then she can locate him again: "You're afraid that you and the dragons aren't enough for me, and that I'm leaving. Is that true?" Or she can be a little sterner: "Have you considered that this might actually be very well thought through? I have no intention of hurting or embarrassing you. That's why I'm talking about it with you, instead of running off to a unicorn auction behind your back."

如果他对她进行煤气灯操控，试图告诉她她并不真的想要她想要的，她定位他的怀疑并中和它："你不想相信这个欲望是我的。但我想要这个。我想要这个给我自己；我想要这个给我们。我想要你和我一起；我想要我们一起做这个。这不是关于Instagram；这是关于我们。"（这是为什么在困难要求之前做正当性练习很重要的重要例子；阿比对埃米利奥越清晰，这就会越有效。这也是顺从风格要求的绝佳例子。）然后她可以再次定位他："你害怕你和龙对我来说不够，我在离开。这是真的吗？"或者她可以更严厉一点："你是否考虑过这可能实际上经过深思熟虑？我无意伤害或羞辱你。这就是为什么我和你说这个，而不是在你背后跑到独角兽拍卖会。"

If he tries to switch sandboxes, she can locate him by not letting him get away with it: "Why are we talking about my credit card bill right now? Am I supposed to change my spending habits before we can talk about getting a unicorn?" Or try something a little softer: "I agree that we need to have clearer communication around my/our spending. But let's set another time to talk about that so we stay with the conversation we're having now."

如果他尝试切换沙箱，她可以通过不让他逃脱来定位他："为什么我们现在在谈论我的信用卡账单？我应该在我们谈论获得独角兽之前改变我的消费习惯吗？"或者尝试更柔和的东西："我同意我们需要就我/我们的支出进行更清晰的沟通。但让我们安排另一个时间来谈论那个，这样我们就能继续我们现在正在进行的对话。"

If he goes on the offensive and attacks her, she could try something like "Do you really believe what you just said about me, or are you just trying to make me feel bad so that I stop talking about this subject, which is obviously terrifying to you?" or "You called me a horrible bitch. Either you believe that or you need to be vicious right now. Which one is it?" (Both of these encourage him to locate himself, and might be all that's needed to get him to calm down and apologize for name-calling. Or cause him to escalate, which is also information.)

如果他继续进攻并攻击她，她可以尝试类似这样的话："你真的相信你刚才对我说的，还是你只是试图让我感觉不好，这样我就会停止谈论这个显然让你恐惧的话题？"或者"你称我为可怕的婊子。要么你相信那个，要么你现在需要恶毒。是哪一个？"（这两者都鼓励他定位自己，可能足以让他冷静下来并为辱骂道歉。或者导致他升级，这也是信息。）

Let's say Emilio responds to that with: "I'm not getting vicious. You're the one trying to humiliate me in front of God and everyone we know."

假设埃米利奥对此回应："我没有变得恶毒。你是那个试图在上帝和我们认识的每个人面前羞辱我的人。"

Success! Abby's got some information to work with now: "You feel humiliated right now, and that sucks. But you're getting ahead of yourself and imagining that what I'm proposing will exclude and embarrass you. Is that true?" Or "I have no intention of hurting or humiliating you. That's why we're talking right now." Or "Nothing has happened yet! We're just sitting here in the living room, talking. You need to be able to tolerate this without fast-forwarding to an imaginary, worst-case-scenario future."

成功！阿比现在有一些信息可以工作："你现在感到被羞辱，这很糟糕。但你在超越自己，想象我提议的会排除和羞辱你。这是真的吗？"或者"我无意伤害或羞辱你。这就是为什么我们现在在谈论。"或者"还没有任何事情发生！我们只是坐在这里的客厅里，在谈话。你需要能够容忍这个，而不要快进到一个想象的、最坏情况的未来。"

If he continues to attack, she can say something like "Say what you need to, but I'd like to slow this down so I hear and understand your concerns." Always, she is trying to elicit more information about his resistance, more data about the tender spots he's hiding and protecting by saying no: "What else?" "What are you scared of losing?" "What do you need right now?" "Say more about that." "What do you mean by that, specifically?" "I see that you're angry; what else are you feeling?" "I want to know more about why you believe this is impossible."

如果他继续攻击，她可以说类似这样的话："说你需要说的，但我想放慢这个，这样我就能听到并理解你的关切。"总是，她试图引出更多关于他抵抗的信息，更多关于他通过说"不"隐藏和保护的敏感点的数据："还有什么？" "你害怕失去什么？" "你现在需要什么？" "多说一点关于那个。" "你具体是什么意思？" "我看到你生气了；你还在感觉什么？" "我想知道更多关于为什么你相信这是不可能的。"

If Emilio shuts down, declaring the topic closed forever, Abby can locate him—"I see that you're upset"—and approve: "I know you're upset because our dragons are important to you, as they are to me. If you need to take a break, that's cool—but you don't get to stay shut down; we're in this together." And then she can go digging: "What would you need to hear in order to keep talking about this? What are you afraid to tell me that makes walking away from this conversation easier than talking?"

如果埃米利奥关闭，宣布这个话题永远关闭，阿比可以定位他——"我看到你很沮丧"——并批准："我知道你很沮丧，因为我们的龙对你很重要，就像它们对我一样。如果你需要休息，那很好——但你不能一直关闭；我们一起面对这个。"然后她可以继续挖掘："你需要听到什么才能继续谈论这个？你害怕告诉我什么，这使得走开比谈话更容易？"

If Emilio is legitimately too upset to continue, Abby might agree to let it go—but not forever. "I understand that you're too upset to have a conversation about this now, but I would like to schedule a time to revisit this when you're less distraught, because I've given this a lot of thought, and the topic isn't going to go away for me."

如果埃米利奥真的太沮丧而无法继续，阿比可能同意让它过去——但不是永远。"我理解你现在太沮丧，无法就此进行对话，但我想安排一个时间，当你不那么心烦意乱时重新讨论这个，因为我已经对此思考了很多，这个话题对我来说不会消失。"

In all of these scenarios (and again, this is just a quick sampling of the virtually infinite ways a conversation like this could go), Abby is returning to the fundamentals. She is paying attention to where Emilio is, approving of it, and using the information he shares to move him from resistance to passion. Her goal is not to get him from angry to not-angry, but into a state where he wants to collaborate and play, to come up with new solutions.

在所有这些场景中（再次，这只是像这样的对话可能进行的几乎无限方式的快速样本），阿比正在回到基本原则。她关注埃米利奥在哪里，批准它，并使用他分享的信息将他从抵抗移动到激情。她的目标不是让他从愤怒到不愤怒，而是进入他想要协作和游戏，想出新解决方案的状态。

If you've become really skilled at gaining legitimacy, you'll recognize what Abby's really doing, which is using language to help Emilio to link his mind to his emotions, and to his body.

如果你已经变得真正熟练于获得正当性，你会认识到阿比真正在做什么，那就是使用语言帮助埃米利奥将他的思维连接到他的情绪，以及他的身体。

It's very common for someone to get stuck in one body or another. For instance, Emilio might indicate that he's stuck in his physical body by saying something like "Can't you see how much pain you're causing me?" or "The thought of having to deal with a unicorn makes me physically sick."

某人被困在一个或另一个身体中是非常常见的。例如，埃米利奥可能通过说类似这样的话来表明他被困在他的身体中："你看不到你给我造成了多少痛苦吗？"或者"想到必须处理独角兽让我身体上感到恶心。"

This is actually a good sign; at least he's in touch with what he's feeling. When Abby locates and approves of this, she can respond with something like "I'm sorry that the thought of raising unicorns makes you feel sick, but hearing that makes me feel flattered and turned on, because it means I married a passionate man." She could use humor: "What if we get a really butch unicorn?"

这实际上是一个好迹象；至少他与他在感觉的东西有联系。当阿比定位并批准这一点时，她可以这样回应："我很抱歉想到养独角兽让你感到恶心，但听到这个让我感到受宠若惊和兴奋，因为这意味着我嫁给了一个有激情的男人。"她可以使用幽默："如果我们得到一个非常男性化的独角兽呢？"

If Emilio responds with something like "Of course I'm afraid. We've sunk everything we have into dragons, and now you're bored?" Abby will again locate and approve: "Have you considered that this isn't just boredom? Have you considered that I knew exactly how difficult this would be for you, and brought it to you anyway? I had doubts before I brought this up, but I decided that if saying my truth was going to ruin us, then we aren't as solid as I want us to be. If I'm hiding something from you, I've already taken a step toward ruining our relationship, and that's not what I want. When has hiding anything from each other ever worked?"

如果埃米利奥回应类似这样的话："我当然害怕。我们已经把我们拥有的一切都投入了龙，现在你厌倦了？"阿比将再次定位并批准："你是否考虑过这不仅仅是厌倦？你是否考虑过我确切地知道这对你来说会有多困难，但仍然把它带给你？在我提出这个之前我有疑虑，但我决定如果说我的真相会毁了我们，那么我们就不是我希望的那么坚固。如果我对你隐瞒什么，我已经朝着毁掉我们的关系迈出了一步，这不是我想要的。彼此隐瞒什么时候起作用过？"

If he's stuck in his head, which is fairly common for men, he might try to logic his way out: "We cannot raise dragons and unicorns at the same time. I know it might feel as if it's possible, but it's not. It's a bad idea; it doesn't make any sense." To break him out of this, Abby can encourage him to get in touch with what he feels: "Putting aside reason for a minute, I just asked you to entertain a very challenging proposition. How did it feel? What emotions came up for you? Are you scared? Does any part of my plan excite you?" (Notice that she's not arguing the merits of the case. Facts never changed anyone's mind; if they did, no one would smoke or eat junk food or drive over the speed limit or vote against their interests.)

如果他被困在他的头脑中，这对男人来说相当常见，他可能会试图用逻辑摆脱它："我们不能同时养龙和独角兽。我知道这可能会感觉像是可能的，但不是。这是一个坏主意；它没有任何意义。"为了让他摆脱这个，阿比可以鼓励他与他在感觉的东西联系："暂时把理性放在一边，我只是要求你考虑一个非常有挑战性的提议。感觉如何？你出现了什么情绪？你害怕吗？我的计划有任何部分让你兴奋吗？"（注意她没有争论案例的优点。事实从未改变任何人的想法；如果它们做到了，没有人会吸烟或吃垃圾食品或超速行驶或投票反对他们的利益。）

Always, she is locating, approving, and using those hot spots to inspire him. "You work so hard and give me so much. This is going to take even more work—hard emotional work—but it could be the next chapter in our dream life. You're seeing how hard this could be. Can you also imagine how fun this could be? For us both?"

总是，她定位、批准，并使用那些热点来激励他。"你工作如此努力，给我如此多。这将需要更多的工作——困难的情绪工作——但它可能是我们梦想生活的下一章。你看到了这会有多困难。你也能想象这会有多有趣吗？对我们两人来说？"

It may take more than one conversation. And it may take imagination: What about a trial period? What if they sign up with an agency that will let them foster a unicorn?

这可能需要不止一次对话。它可能需要想象力：试用期怎么样？如果他们与一家允许他们寄养独角兽的机构签约呢？

I'd encourage Abby to celebrate any progress the two of them make toward what she wants. Of course, there is also the possibility that the two of them will come up with a third solution, one that will bring back the fun and the spontaneity of the life they had when they first got the dragons without getting any unicorns at all. Maybe Emilio makes a tender list of his own boundaries and concerns, and within it reveals something he's always wanted—a desire Abby might be more than happy to pursue with him, one she didn't even know she had herself. (This, of course, is how they end up breeding phoenixes.)

我会鼓励阿比庆祝他们两人朝着她想要的方向取得的任何进展。当然，也有可能他们两人会想出第三种解决方案，一个会带回他们第一次得到龙时生活中的乐趣和自发性的解决方案，而根本不需要任何独角兽。也许埃米利奥制作了一份他自己的界限和关切的温柔清单，在其中揭示了他一直想要的东西——阿比可能非常乐意与他追求的东西，一个她甚至不知道自己拥有的东西。（当然，这就是他们最终如何培育凤凰的。）

This may seem like a silly example—but the very same principles Abby is using with Emilio apply whether you're trying to get your con-man dad to show up for his grandkid's graduation, or asking your boss about going to a conference in Beijing: You locate the other person's resistance, name it, acknowledge it, celebrate it. And you keep your attention out so you know the next move to make toward influence. My intention with these mock arguments is not to provide you with a cheat sheet of things that you might say, but to model the myriad ways a conversation like this could go—if you, like Abby, continue to return to the fundamentals (locate, approve, influence), stay with what's alive, and use your imagination.

这可能看起来像一个愚蠢的例子——但无论你是试图让你的骗子父亲出现在他孙子的毕业典礼上，还是询问你的老板关于去北京参加会议的事，阿比与埃米利奥使用的完全相同原则都适用：你定位另一个人的抵抗，命名它，承认它，庆祝它。你保持注意力在外，这样你就知道朝着影响的下一步是什么。我用这些模拟论证的意图不是为你提供你可能说的话的作弊表，而是模拟像这样的对话可能进行的无数种方式——如果你，像阿比一样，继续回到基本原则（定位、批准、影响），保持与活着的东西在一起，并使用你的想象力。

Working with other people's resistance in this way is a skill—maybe the most valuable one in this book because of the potential it unlocks. When the person you're leading trusts you enough to reveal their resistance, and to say what's actually happening for them, then you not only lead more powerfully, you can lead using all of that person's resources, imagination, and a kind of connectedness that there is no substitute for.

以这种方式处理他人的抵抗是一种技能——可能是这本书中最有价值的，因为它释放的潜力。当你领导的人足够信任你，能够揭示他们的抵抗，并说出对他们来说实际正在发生的事情时，你不仅会更强大地领导，你还可以使用那个人的所有资源、想象力，以及一种无法替代的连接来领导。

Just as with our own hot spots of suppressed shame, when you acknowledge the hated, hateful aspects of another person, a whole new field opens. Possibilities abound, not just for the next negotiation, but true collaboration.

就像我们自己被压抑羞耻的热点一样，当你承认另一个人的被憎恨、可恨的方面时，一个全新的领域打开了。可能性很多，不仅是为了下一次谈判，而且是为了真正的协作。

Preparing for a Difficult Ask | 准备一个困难的要求

When faced with the idea of creating a cheat sheet on how to prepare for a difficult conversation, my body squirms. On the one hand, I'd love to create something simple—a checklist that a reader can return to, six easy steps that she could take to check in with herself and integrate what she's learned.

当面对创建一个关于如何准备困难对话的作弊表的想法时，我的身体会扭动。一方面，我很想创建一些简单的东西——一个读者可以返回的检查清单，她可以采取的六个简单步骤来与自己核对并整合她学到的东西。

On the other hand, this book is about subverting formulas—breaking with convention, and with our conditioning. Not to mention that I know exactly what happens when I'm in a room with a student asking me how to prepare for a specific Difficult Ask, which is that neither one of us could ever predict or prepare for what would come out of that conversation.

另一方面，这本书是关于颠覆公式——打破惯例，打破我们的条件作用。更不用说我知道当我在房间里与一个学生问我如何准备一个特定的困难要求时会发生什么，那就是我们两人都无法预测或准备那场对话会产生什么。

The real answer is that, if Abby came to me talking about unicorns, I would put my attention on her and ask her a series of questions, trying to feel—and to help her feel—what is most alive.

真正的答案是，如果阿比来找我谈论独角兽，我会把注意力放在她身上，问她一系列问题，试图感受——并帮助她感受——什么是最有活力的。

After a Things Unsaid exercise, we might learn that she's still angry with Emilio for the way he grieved (or failed to, from her perspective) the miscarriage she had when they first got together. We might uncover that both of them have too much shame to face his gambling addiction, or any of a thousand other secrets. We might discover, chasing what's most alive, that a unicorn is not exactly what Abby wants at all.

在一次"未曾言说之事"（Things Unsaid）练习后，我们可能会了解到，她仍然对埃米利奥感到愤怒，因为他为她在他们第一次在一起时流产的悲伤方式（或者从她的角度来看，他未能这样做）。我们可能会发现，他们两人都有太多的羞耻，无法面对他的赌博成瘾，或者一千个其他秘密中的任何一个。我们可能会发现，追逐最有活力的东西，独角兽根本不是阿比真正想要的。

The good news is that the process I'd go through with Abby is exactly what I've taught you to do throughout this book, with yourselves and with one another: it wouldn't be me domming her, but chasing her life force. And it very well might send us down a path neither of us would have expected.

好消息是，我与阿比一起经历的过程正是我在这本书中教你要做的，与自己和彼此：不是我支配她，而是追逐她的生命力。它很可能把我们带到我们都没有预料到的路上。

The tools in this book aren't laws or formulas, but compasses that point you toward what's most alive. They're presented in a sequence so that the book makes sense as a system, but I trust you and your Mistress group to use them however they work best for you: out of order, mixed and matched, or reinvented entirely in accordance with what feels most alive. Follow what's most exciting, most pleasurable, most confronting. Hunt everything you're drawn to, and see if it scratches the itch.

这本书中的工具不是法律或公式，而是指向最有活力东西的指南针。它们按顺序呈现，使这本书作为一个系统有意义，但我相信你和你的女主人小组会以最适合你的方式使用它们：不按顺序，混合搭配，或完全根据感觉最有活力的东西重新发明。跟随最令人兴奋、最愉快、最面对的东西。追逐所有你被吸引的东西，看看它是否搔到痒处。

So use the template that follows—or Frankenstein it into something that works better for you. Whatever you use, do so to deepen and honor and respect the vitality barometer that you are.

所以使用下面的模板——或者像弗兰肯斯坦一样把它拼凑成更适合你的东西。无论你使用什么，都要这样做，以深化和尊重你就是那个活力晴雨表。

Desire Check: Do a quick check to make sure the thing you want is big enough, broad enough, specific enough. Does it need to be more inclusive, more expansive, more outrageous, more visionary? Play with the Ask itself—is it what the desire feels like?

欲望检查：快速检查以确保你想要的东西足够大、足够广泛、足够具体。它是否需要更包容、更广阔、更出格、更有远见？玩一下要求本身——它是欲望的感觉吗？

Legitimacy Exercise: Next, you'll do three full cycles of the Legitimacy exercise to ground your signal. Which means: You'll connect to the physical sensations that come up when you imagine that you already have what you're asking for. You'll notice what emotions come up when you imagine already having it, and you'll imagine what having this will change for you. You'll tap body, heart, and mind—and you'll do it three times each (as on this page).

正当性练习：接下来，你将做三个完整的正当性练习周期来接地你的信号。这意味着：你将连接到当你想象你已经拥有你要求的东西时出现的身体感觉。你将注意到当你想象已经拥有它时出现的情绪，你将想象拥有这个将为你带来什么改变。你将敲击身体、心脏和头脑——每个你做三次（如本页所示）。

Write Your Ask: Write down your Ask in a single sentence, three times: first, neutrally, then using submissive language, and then using dominant language.

写下你的要求：在一句话中写下你的要求，三次：首先，中性，然后使用顺从语言，然后使用主导语言。

Do a Three-Way Ask: If you're concerned about congruence, do a Three-Way Ask with your Mistress group. You'll ask first, however the request comes out naturally, then you'll role-play a version using a very dominant state of attention (allow yourself to play, and even exaggerate this) and a very submissive one, where you get deeply connected to what you want. Isolate your worst fear about asking this person for this particular Ask (seeming like a whining child who can't take care of herself when you're asking for a loan from your dad, for instance) and lean into role-playing that fear. Then practice your Ask again.

做一个三方要求：如果你担心一致性，与你的女主人小组做一个三方要求。你首先询问，无论请求如何自然地出现，然后你将使用非常主导的注意力状态（允许自己玩，甚至夸大这个）和非常顺从的状态角色扮演一个版本，在那里你与你想要的东西深度连接。隔离你对向这个人提出这个特定要求的最坏恐惧（例如，当你向你父亲借钱时，看起来像一个不能照顾自己的哭闹孩子），并投入到角色扮演那种恐惧中。然后再次练习你的要求。

Do Legitimacy for the Person You're Asking: Next you're going to do a version of the Legitimacy exercise for the other person. You're going to address their mental, emotional, and physical concerns—the positive and the negative. See how their landscape changes with what you're proposing. What will your Ask cost them? What amazing additions will it bring to their lives?

为你要求的人做正当性：接下来，你将为另一个人做一个版本的正当性练习。你将解决他们的心理、情绪和身体关切——积极的和消极的。看看他们的图景如何随着你提议的改变。你的要求会让他们付出什么代价？它会为他们的生活带来什么惊人的补充？

It's in the third, or mental, stage of the Legitimacy exercise you're doing on their behalf that your own case will get built.

在你代表他们做的正当性练习的第三个或心理阶段，你自己的案例将被建立。

Role-Play the Ask: If you're working with a Mistress group, you may also want to role-play the Ask. (You can also do this with a trusted friend.) Switch sides, so that you play the person you're going up against, and another Mistress plays you. This encourages you to explore the objections you're likely to face, which is another form of preparation. And it gives you access to a greater range of possible responses. How do your fellow Mistresses, with all their varying skills and life experiences, greet the objections you lob at them?

角色扮演要求：如果你与女主人小组一起工作，你可能还想角色扮演要求。（你也可以与一个值得信赖的朋友一起做这个。）切换角色，这样你扮演你将面对的人，另一个女主人扮演你。这鼓励你探索你可能面临的反对意见，这是另一种形式的准备。它让你能够接触到更大范围的可能回应。你的女主人同伴，凭借他们各种不同的技能和生活经验，如何迎接你向它们投掷的反对意见？

Make a Plan: You may also want to brainstorm the logistics of the meeting with your sister Mistresses or a friend. Because, and this is especially true if the conversation is an important one, you're going to want to do some planning on when you ask, and where. His office or yours? The living room? The bedroom? A restaurant? Do you want to do it at the beginning of the day or at the end? After dinner or before?

制定计划：你可能还想与你的女主人姐妹或朋友头脑风暴会议的物流。因为，如果对话是一个重要的对话，这一点尤其正确，你将想要做一些关于何时提问和何处的计划。他的办公室还是你的？客厅？卧室？餐厅？你想在一天开始时还是结束时做？晚饭后还是之前？

It's worth taking this kind of special care if a meeting is important enough. You want to feel excited about inviting the other person into a space where they're going to be safely held, and where they can be however they need to be throughout this conversation.

如果会议足够重要，值得采取这种特殊照顾。你想对邀请另一个人进入一个他们将被安全持有的空间感到兴奋，在这个空间中，他们可以在整个对话中保持他们需要的任何状态。

State Your Intentions: As for the conversation itself, I do think it's helpful to state your intention for the conversation, and set a time limit. This makes a container for the conversation, which increases everyone's sense of safety. Even though it seems like a difficult conversation should be allowed to take as long as it needs to, it's good to have an "out by." That way, if the conversation becomes unbearable to either party, they know how much time is left.

陈述你的意图：至于对话本身，我确实认为陈述你对对话的意图并设定时间限制是有帮助的。这为对话创建了一个容器，增加了每个人的安全感。尽管看起来困难的对话应该被允许花费它需要的时间，但有一个"截止时间"是好的。这样，如果对话对任何一方来说变得无法忍受，他们知道还剩多少时间。

Remember: Resolving a Difficult Ask may take a whole series of conversations. You can always pick up where you've left off.

记住：解决一个困难的要求可能需要一整系列对话。你总是可以从你离开的地方继续。
