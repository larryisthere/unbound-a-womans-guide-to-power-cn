# Chapter 16: LET THEM LIGHT YOU UP! | 第十六章：让他们点亮你！

## The Power of the Outrageous Ask | 大胆要求的力量

Remember the student who hated her desk? The one who said she'd work from the floor, if only her boss would meet with her and give her ideas a fair shot?

还记得那个讨厌她桌子的学生吗？那个说她会在地上工作的人，只要她的老板能和她见面并给她想法一个公平的机会？

You don't seriously think I let her stop there, do you?

你不会真的认为我让她停在那里吧，是吗？

We're not in this to beg—and settle—for crumbs. Every request, suggestion, invitation, or Ask has a tipping point. Below that point, the question is basically what can be done to fix a problem—to get back to zero. But I have a higher purpose for your Asks. I want them to move into the space of creation—not just to correct a mistake or some perceived flaw you see in yourself, but to manifest something great in the world. I don't want you running around fixing yourselves, plastering holes in a crumbling wall, using your attention to find problems and make minor corrections. My vision is one in which you harness your attention and imagination to fully acknowledge what's present, both good and bad, and then extend invitations that will help you to make your world just as you like it.

我们不是在这里乞求——并满足于——面包屑。每个请求、建议、邀请或要求都有一个临界点。在那一点以下，问题基本上是可以做什么来修复一个问题——回到零。但我对你的要求有更高的目的。我希望它们进入创造的空间——不仅仅是为了纠正错误或你看到的自己的一些感知缺陷，而是在世界上显现一些伟大的东西。我不想让你四处奔走修复自己，在摇摇欲坠的墙上修补洞，用你的注意力去寻找问题并进行小的修正。我的愿景是，你利用你的注意力和想象力来充分承认存在的，无论是好的还是坏的，然后扩展邀请，这将帮助你使你的世界如你所愿。

You'll know you've met this tipping point when you vibrate with everything the Ask will make possible for you. When you meet the possibility of it coming true not with "Yeah, that's fine" or "I guess that's better" but "Holy shit, that would be huge!"

当你在震动中感受到要求将为你带来的一切可能性时，你会知道你已经达到了这个临界点。当你遇到它成真的可能性时，不是用"是的，那很好"或"我想那更好"，而是"天哪，那将是巨大的！"

These kinds of Asks—often Outrageous and Difficult—also transform the people around you.

这些类型的要求——通常是出格和困难的——也会转变你周围的人。

Why do you think it's such a relief to most people when you make a specific Ask? Yes, there's a comfort in the fact that they finally know what you want, which means they're not perpetually guessing and getting it wrong, or guessing and getting it partially right. But the real satisfaction comes from the fact that they get to express the love and respect and admiration that they have for you in a way that lights you up.

为什么你认为当你提出一个具体的要求时，对大多数人来说这是一种解脱？是的，他们终于知道你想要什么，这有一种舒适感，这意味着他们不会永远猜测并弄错，或者猜测并部分正确。但真正的满足来自于他们能够以点燃你的方式表达他们对你的爱、尊重和钦佩。

This might be one of the most crucial points in this book, because another dodge women use to back away from Asking is to ask for less than what they really want—which has the exact opposite effect of what's intended.

这可能是本书中最关键的一点，因为女性用来回避要求的另一个策略是要求少于她们真正想要的——这与预期效果完全相反。

I call this concept the Right-Sized Ask. And you should know: oftentimes, the right size is Outrageous.

我称这个概念为"合适大小的要求"。你应该知道：通常，合适的大小是出格的。

### The Right-Sized Ask | 合适大小的要求

Too often, I see women begging—badly—for crumbs, accepting them, and then blowing a gasket down the line because they're starving.

太常见的是，我看到女性乞求——糟糕地——面包屑，接受它们，然后因为她们在挨饿而在后来大发雷霆。

The problem, often, isn't that they're asking too much. It's that they're not asking enough.

问题，通常，不是她们要求太多。而是她们要求得不够。

Say you're scared to ask for 100 percent of what you really want. Maybe you're not sure you deserve what you're asking for, or you don't feel like you've earned it, or what you're asking for is really big—so outrageous it scares you. Even if you did ask them for it, you're not sure they'd be able to pull it off.

假设你害怕要求100%的你真正想要的。也许你不确定你应得你要求的，或者你不觉得你赢得了它，或者你要求的真的很大——如此出格以至于让你害怕。即使你确实要求他们，你也不确定他们能够做到。

So before you've even opened your mouth, you negotiate yourself down and ask for only 80 percent of what you want.

所以在你甚至张开嘴之前，你就把自己谈判下来，只要求你想要的80%。

You know what's going to happen? They're going to do exactly what you asked them to do, because you're going to be super-influential after reading this book. But when they offer it to you—"Look! I did it!"—they're not going to see you light up. Because it wasn't 100 percent, and it didn't hit the spot.

你知道会发生什么吗？他们会完全按照你要求他们的去做，因为读了这本书后你会非常有影响力。但当他们把它提供给你——"看！我做到了！"——他们不会看到你被点亮。因为它不是100%，它没有击中要害。

A person's animal body lights up when a gift really works, and the other person's animal body knows it. When the present he chose was truly perfect, when the erotic adventure he planned was exactly what you always wanted, when the advice was what you most needed to hear, you will positively overflow with pleasure and gratitude and joy, and he will get to bask in your glow: "I did that! I lit her up." That lights him up, too.

当礼物真的起作用时，一个人的动物身体会点亮，另一个人的动物身体知道这一点。当他选择的礼物真正完美时，当他计划的色情冒险正是你一直想要的时，当建议是你最需要听到的时候，你会积极地溢出快乐、感激和喜悦，他将沐浴在你的光芒中："我做到了！我点亮了她。"这也点亮了他。

But if you compromise even a little bit in your request, you've doomed him to labor in vain. "I did all that for 'thanks' and a lukewarm smile?" It doesn't matter what words you choose, or how good your acting chops might be; even if you've laid the gratitude on thick, it won't land.

但如果你在要求中妥协甚至一点点，你就注定让他徒劳地工作。"我做了所有这些，就为了'谢谢'和一个不冷不热的微笑？"无论你选择什么词语，或者你的演技可能有多好；即使你把感激表达得很厚，它也不会着陆。

Most of the time, women don't even ask for 80 percent. We ask for 20 percent of what we want. Before we even make the Ask, we're negotiating against ourselves. "I want to try that fancy French restaurant, but he'll never go for that on a weeknight. I guess we can go to the place on the corner instead."

大多数时候，女性甚至不要求80%。我们要求我们想要的20%。甚至在我们提出要求之前，我们就在和自己谈判。"我想试试那家高级法国餐厅，但他永远不会在周中晚上去那里。我想我们可以去街角的那个地方。"

This is a case where even 99 percent right is 100 percent wrong.

这是一个即使99%正确也是100%错误的情况。

An Ask not only has to be specific; it has to be big enough to light you up for real.

一个要求不仅必须具体；它必须足够大才能真正点亮你。

So look at your Asking Practice and supersize those Asks. You remember how transformative an Outrageous Ask can be. How big does an Ask have to get before it's really the right size? Let yourself overshoot the mark, to make sure you're not inadvertently settling for crumbs.

所以看看你的要求练习，放大那些要求。你记得一个出格的要求可能有多么变革性。一个要求必须有多大才能达到真正合适的大小？让自己超过标记，确保你不会无意中满足于面包屑。

### The Path to Power | 通往力量之路

As I've said before, power isn't sitting on a yoga mat with an ionizer and a humidifier and feeling powerful. And it's not asking for what you're entitled to, or what you've already earned. It's being legendary in the world.

正如我之前所说，力量不是坐在有电离器和加湿器的瑜伽垫上感觉强大。它不是要求你应得的，或你已经赢得的。它是在世界上成为传奇。

This is how you achieve power: by going out and doing powerful things in the world.

这就是你如何获得力量：走出去，在世界上做强大的事情。

Make yourself strong—feel good! But know that if your attention stays turned inward, the default state of attention for women, then the slightest nudge will be enough to set you wobbling, hurt and defensive and pissed off and insecure.

让自己变得强大——感觉良好！但要知道，如果你的注意力保持向内，这是女性的默认注意力状态，那么最轻微的推动就足以让你摇摆不定，受伤和防御，愤怒和不安全。

You can be as positive as you want; you can process and achieve catharsis and closure. You can work on yourself all day and feel great—but don't you dare work for a bully, or walk by a construction site, or be around anyone suffering from anxiety or depression or addiction, or embark on a difficult conversation with someone about the sex you want to have or the money you want to make or the world you want to live in.

你可以尽可能积极；你可以处理并实现宣泄和了结。你可以整天工作在自己身上，感觉很好——但不要为一个恶霸工作，或走过建筑工地，或与任何患有焦虑、抑郁或成瘾的人在一起，或与某人就你想拥有的性、你想赚的钱或你想生活的世界进行困难的对话。

You've got all the skills you need to go big; it's time to try something different. Go out and get something fucking outrageous for yourself, using the tools in the book, and then tell me how you feel.

你已经拥有了做大所需的所有技能；是时候尝试一些不同的东西了。走出去，为自己获得一些他妈的出格的东西，使用书中的工具，然后告诉我你的感觉。

### The Transformational Power of the Outrageous Ask | 出格要求的变革力量

I know, better than anyone, the power of the enormous, transformative, creative Ask. The Academy itself was born out of one.

我比任何人都知道巨大的、变革性的、创造性的要求的力量。学院本身就是从一个要求中诞生的。

Ruben and I were dating while he was trying to decide whether to return to doing incredibly important humanitarian work in Africa or to stay in New York with me. It was a complicated time in my own life; I was distracted, desperately searching for a way to live my own life's purpose. We hit a crossroads: if he was going to stay, he explained, he needed more—more of my time, more commitment, more attention.

鲁本和我在约会时，他正在试图决定是回到非洲做令人难以置信的重要人道主义工作，还是和我一起留在纽约。这是我生活中的一个复杂时期；我分心了，拼命寻找一种方式来活出我自己人生的目的。我们遇到了一个十字路口：如果他打算留下来，他解释说，他需要更多——更多我的时间，更多承诺，更多注意力。

I responded with an e-mail so audacious that my hands still shake when I think about pressing Send:

我回复了一封如此大胆的电子邮件，当我想起按下发送按钮时，我的手仍然在颤抖：

> I have a totally unreasonable and outrageous request. After all you’ve done for me, I want even more. I am on the cusp of everything I’ve ever wanted. I have to be fierce for this. I have no choice but to completely disregard your request for attention and tell you what I need. What I need so that I can build the life I want. I am looking for a man who will put his primary attention on making my creativity the source of our livelihood. This isn’t a request for a nice boyfriend. It’s a desire for the greatest most devoted partner in love and work that’s ever lived. I’ve never met a man capable of what I am asking until I met you. Of course I want it to be you. I have struggled on the cusp of bringing my creations into the world for a while now. Here I am again, but at the right place and at the right time. Crossing over is the most important thing right now, more important than dealing with darkness, even more important than keeping you around and, yes, more important than meeting your needs. I know exactly what I am saying. After your hurt over being invisible and not having attention on you the way you need, I am pretty mercilessly responding with “yes and I want even more from you.” More attention on my gifts, strengths, my soul’s work in the world. It might not be fair but it is the truth of what I need and what is happening. The alternatives are dismal to me. You don’t owe me shit. I can’t ask for this on the basis of debt. I can’t even promise that if you choose to play the game I am proposing, you will eventually get yours. I am asking you to assist me in every way possible in bringing my work into the world, be devoted, enthusiastic, hard-working, without asking for anything in return. I realize that this presents you with a very powerful option to decline. I don’t believe there is anyone who can be this and do this for me and with me. That doesn’t mean you should. You are the greatest man I have ever met but I am prepared to do it alone. You’ve never witnessed me in the throes of work passion and you should know that it might leave you feeling even more neglected, unless you can find personal satisfaction in connecting with me through the work and serving what I am creating, and me as the creator of it by extension. Please understand that I have written this e-mail with the highest respect and deepest love.

I have a totally unreasonable and outrageous request. After all you've done for me, I want even more.

我有一个完全不合理和出格的请求。在你为我做了所有这一切之后，我想要更多。

I am on the cusp of everything I've ever wanted. I have to be fierce for this. I have no choice but to completely disregard your request for attention and tell you what I need. What I need so that I can build the life I want.

我正处于我想要的一切的边缘。我必须为此变得凶猛。我别无选择，只能完全无视你要求注意力的请求，告诉你我需要什么。我需要什么，这样我才能建立我想要的生活。

I am looking for a man who will put his primary attention on making my creativity the source of our livelihood.

我正在寻找一个会把他的主要注意力放在让我的创造力成为我们生计来源的男人。

This isn't a request for a nice boyfriend. It's a desire for the greatest most devoted partner in love and work that's ever lived. I've never met a man capable of what I am asking until I met you. Of course I want it to be you.

这不是对好男友的要求。这是对有史以来最伟大、最忠诚的爱情和工作伙伴的渴望。我从未遇到过能够做到我所要求的人，直到我遇到你。我当然希望那是你。

I have struggled on the cusp of bringing my creations into the world for a while now. Here I am again, but at the right place and at the right time. Crossing over is the most important thing right now, more important than dealing with darkness, even more important than keeping you around and, yes, more important than meeting your needs.

我在把我创造的东西带入世界的边缘挣扎了有一段时间了。我又在这里了，但在正确的地方和正确的时间。跨越是最重要的事情，比处理黑暗更重要，甚至比让你在身边更重要，是的，比满足你的需求更重要。

I know exactly what I am saying. After your hurt over being invisible and not having attention on you the way you need, I am pretty mercilessly responding with "yes and I want even more from you." More attention on my gifts, strengths, my soul's work in the world. It might not be fair but it is the truth of what I need and what is happening.

我确切地知道我在说什么。在你因为隐形和没有按你需要的方式得到注意力而受伤之后，我相当无情地回应说"是的，我想要从你那里得到更多。"更多注意力放在我的天赋、力量、我在世界上的灵魂工作上。这可能不公平，但这是我所需要的和正在发生的真相。

The alternatives are dismal to me.

对我来说，替代方案是令人沮丧的。

You don't owe me shit. I can't ask for this on the basis of debt. I can't even promise that if you choose to play the game I am proposing, you will eventually get yours.

你不欠我任何东西。我不能基于债务来要求这个。我甚至不能承诺，如果你选择玩我提议的游戏，你最终会得到你的。

I am asking you to assist me in every way possible in bringing my work into the world, be devoted, enthusiastic, hard-working, without asking for anything in return.

我要求你以一切可能的方式帮助我把我的工作带入世界，要专注、热情、努力工作，不要求任何回报。

I realize that this presents you with a very powerful option to decline.

我意识到这给了你一个非常强大的拒绝选项。

I don't believe there is anyone who can be this and do this for me and with me. That doesn't mean you should. You are the greatest man I have ever met but I am prepared to do it alone. You've never witnessed me in the throes of work passion and you should know that it might leave you feeling even more neglected, unless you can find personal satisfaction in connecting with me through the work and serving what I am creating, and me as the creator of it by extension.

我不相信有人能够成为这个并为我做这个和与我一起做这个。这并不意味着你应该。你是我见过的最伟大的男人，但我准备独自做这件事。你从未目睹过我在工作激情的痛苦中，你应该知道这可能会让你感到更加被忽视，除非你能通过在工作和为我所创造的东西服务，以及通过扩展为我作为创造者服务中找到个人满足。

Please understand that I have written this e-mail with the highest respect and deepest love.

请理解，我是以最高的尊重和最深的爱写下这封电子邮件的。

The request that started this exchange was to go to the movies together more.

开始这次交流的请求是多一起去看电影。

Ruben loves going to the movies, but every time there was something he wanted to see, he'd find me surrounded by a pile of books, making furious notes, and wanting to get into some intense conversation about gender and influence. As intense and thrilling as those conversations were, they weren't intimate, and Ruben needed more.

鲁本喜欢看电影，但每次有他想看的东西时，他会发现我被一堆书包围，做着疯狂的笔记，想要进行一些关于性别和影响力的激烈对话。尽管这些对话既激烈又刺激，但它们不亲密，鲁本需要更多。

I countered his small Ask with an Outrageous Ask—a greedy, selfish one, that he give up everything, his job, his financial security, even our relationship, to help me. He wanted to go to a show; I asked him to go to war.

我用一个出格的要求反击他的小要求——一个贪婪、自私的要求，他放弃一切，他的工作，他的经济安全，甚至我们的关系，来帮助我。他想要去看一场演出；我要求他去战争。

In that same e-mail, I went on to make very specific work-related Asks of him, and others about how our financial and domestic life together would need to change in order to entirely support my work.

在同一封电子邮件中，我继续对他提出非常具体的工作相关要求，以及关于我们的财务和家庭生活如何需要改变以完全支持我的工作的其他要求。

My Outrageous Ask didn't come out of a calculated understanding of exactly where we were and what each of us needed. Instead, it was a cry from my heart: "I need this, I want this, come join me!" We didn't even know at that point that we were going to start a school.

我的出格要求不是来自对我们确切位置和我们每个人需要什么的计算理解。相反，这是我发自内心的呼喊："我需要这个，我想要这个，来加入我！"我们甚至不知道在那时我们将开办一所学校。

But when I came home that night, he had an enormous smile on his face. Yes, he'd give me everything I wanted and needed; yes, he'd join me in this adventure. We went from being a new couple squabbling about balancing quality time with professional time to throwing both quality time and our professional lives out the window to start a crusade.

但当我那天晚上回到家时，他脸上有一个巨大的微笑。是的，他会给我一切我想要和需要的；是的，他会和我一起进行这次冒险。我们从一对关于平衡优质时间和专业时间的新情侣变成了把优质时间和我们的专业生活都扔出窗外去开始一次圣战。

My Outrageous Ask gave Ruben something to fight for that was bigger than a war zone. And it unwittingly opened the gateway to a bigger desire he had, one I hadn't even known was there. While he was in Africa, meeting with providers about prenatal care and maternal mortality statistics and other issues directly related to women's health, more often than not he was having those conversations in a room without a single woman. He'd never articulated this to me, but he had already understood in an on-the-ground, embodied way that he wasn't ever going to be able to create the kind of change he wanted to see unless the issue of gender equality had been addressed.

我的出格要求给了鲁本一些比战区更大的东西去战斗。它无意中打开了一个他拥有的更大欲望的网关，一个我甚至不知道存在的欲望。当他在非洲时，与提供者会面讨论产前护理和孕产妇死亡率统计数据以及与女性健康直接相关的其他问题时，大多数情况下，他是在一个房间里进行这些对话，房间里没有一个女人。他从未向我表达过这一点，但他已经以一种实地、具身的方式理解了，除非性别平等问题得到解决，否则他永远无法创造他想要看到的那种改变。

There's going to be a time for Ruben to talk about what he's learned from being the only man in the room; that's not my story to tell. But much of what I teach now was born in the conversations between the two of us—the ones we had before I asked, and the conversations we had afterward.

鲁本会有一个时间来谈论他从成为房间里唯一的男人中学到了什么；那不是我要讲的故事。但我现在教的大部分内容都诞生在我们两人的对话中——我在要求之前我们进行的对话，以及之后我们进行的对话。

This is why the school we run together is not a woman-only space. We practice with male volunteers, and every weekend class involves asking an army of men in our lives to send us texts, letting us know that they're thinking of us. Men and women go together; we need to know how to do this together. Transformation of womankind and the world cannot happen without a transformation of the way women are with men.

这就是为什么我们一起运营的学校不是只对女性开放的空间。我们与男性志愿者一起练习，每个周末的课程都涉及要求我们生活中的一群男人给我们发短信，让我们知道他们在想着我们。男人和女人一起走；我们需要知道如何一起做这件事。女性世界和世界的转变不可能发生，除非女性与男性相处的方式发生转变。

But in order to excite and incite men to join our crusade, in order to turn them into our greatest allies, we have to Ask.

但为了激励和煽动男人加入我们的圣战，为了把他们变成我们最伟大的盟友，我们必须要求。

In class, we use the Three-Way Ask as an opportunity for the students to role-play Difficult Asks. What is so transformative about watching these is not how easily or well we are able to clean up a woman's energy so that she achieves congruence. What is truly remarkable is how often an Outrageous Ask is Right-Sized.

在课堂上，我们使用三方要求作为学生角色扮演困难要求的机会。观看这些如此变革性的原因不是我们能够多么轻松或很好地清理女性的能量，以便她达到一致性。真正引人注目的是，一个出格的要求经常是合适大小的。

Let me show you with two examples of the Three-Way Ask. To remind you, this is when a woman asks however she would ask if she has to do it right now. Then she asks again, using "you" language and a strongly dominant state of attention, and then a third time in the surrendered, submissive state, turned in on herself and her own experience, using "I" language that communicates her connection. Often, I push her to exaggerate both states of attention when she's role-playing, and to concentrate specifically on her worst fears; this frees up the energy trapped in those forbidden roles.

让我用两个三方要求的例子向你展示。提醒你，这是当一个女人无论如何都会问，如果她必须现在就做的话。然后她再次问，使用"你"的语言和强烈的支配注意力状态，然后第三次在投降、顺从的状态中，转向她自己和她的经历，使用传达她联系的"我"语言。通常，我推动她在角色扮演时夸大两种注意力状态，并专门专注于她最糟糕的恐惧；这释放了被困在那些被禁止角色中的能量。

Ruth volunteers to do a Three-Way Ask. She wants to role-play asking her ex-husband to pay his share of their children's tuition. He's supposed to send her a check every year, according to the agreement they signed, but he's fallen behind, like he always does, on what he owes her.

露丝自愿做一个三方要求。她想角色扮演要求她的前夫支付他们孩子学费中他应该付的部分。根据他们签署的协议，他应该每年给她寄一张支票，但他像往常一样，在欠她的钱上落后了。

During her first unfiltered Ask, this bright, professional woman slumps in her chair as she says, "I want you to pay half the kids' tuition, like you're supposed to." The request is completely mangled by the bitterness and hopelessness, resignation, and self-blame she feels. It would have been cleaner if she'd just said "Fuck you"—but if she could say that, or any of the other Things Unsaid that power her unalchemized rage, she wouldn't have to.

在她第一次未过滤的要求中，这个聪明、专业的女人瘫坐在椅子上，说："我想你支付孩子们学费的一半，就像你应该做的那样。"这个请求完全被她感受到的苦涩、绝望、顺从和自我责备所扭曲。如果她只是说"去你的"会更干净——但如果她能说那个，或者任何其他为她的未炼金愤怒提供动力的未曾言说之事，她就不必这样做了。

I have Ruth stand. Anger moves upward and outward, so standing is a good first step toward accessing the dominant state of attention. "Say 'Fuck you,'" I tell her, and she does—but she's not entirely comfortable with swearing, and she's clearly scared of him. I hand her the riding crop, have her place it in the center of the volunteer's chest, and instruct her to let that riding crop lead her attention directly into his body.

我让露丝站起来。愤怒向上和向外移动，所以站立是朝着进入支配注意力状态的良好第一步。"说'去你的'，"我告诉她，她说了——但她对咒骂并不完全舒适，她显然害怕他。我给她马鞭，让她把它放在志愿者的胸口中心，并指示她让那个马鞭引导她的注意力直接进入他的身体。

"Fuck him why?" I ask. "What has he done?"

"去他的为什么？"我问。"他做了什么？"

"Fuck you for making me ask for what you should automatically do."

"去你的，让我问你应该自动做的事情。"

I egg her on. "Keep going!"

我怂恿她。"继续！"

"Fuck you for doing this to me again; you pulled this shit last year, too."

"去你的，又对我这样做；你去年也这样做了。"

"Oh? So he owes you eight thousand dollars, not four?"

"哦？所以他欠你八千美元，不是四千？"

She's taken aback for a second, then recovers herself: "Fuck you, you owe me eight grand. And after all you put me through! Fuck you!" She's still a little hesitant—something feels weak. So I ask: "What did he put you through?"

她吃了一惊，然后恢复自己："去你的，你欠我八千块。在你让我经历的所有这些之后！去你的！"她仍然有点犹豫——有些东西感觉软弱。所以我问："他让你经历了什么？"

I have her vent a really messy—aggressive, apologetic, cruel—Things Unsaid. As I suspected, there are a lot of things she hasn't told her scary, temper-prone ex-husband. When the dust has settled, I ask: "Are you sure eight thousand dollars is enough?"

我让她发泄一个真正混乱的——激进的、道歉的、残酷的——未曾言说之事。正如我怀疑的那样，有很多事情她没有告诉她可怕、容易发脾气的 ex-husband。当尘埃落定时，我问："你确定八千美元够吗？"

What I mean by that is: What kind of role are you assigning him right now? Right now, she's cast him as the guy who failed at his marriage, the guy who's late with all the checks, if he sends them at all. "Do you know how easy it is for him to procrastinate or forget altogether when signing those checks serves as a reminder of what a loser he is? What Ask could you make that would give him a different role?"

我的意思是：你现在给他分配了什么角色？现在，她把他塑造成一个在婚姻中失败的男人，一个所有支票都迟到的男人，如果他寄出它们的话。"你知道当他签署那些支票作为提醒他是一个失败者时，他拖延或完全忘记是多么容易吗？你能提出什么要求来给他一个不同的角色？"

She shakes her head. "Forget about it. Trust me: I know this man. If I can't get him to do this, I can't get him to do anything more."

她摇摇头。"算了吧。相信我：我了解这个男人。如果我不能让他做这个，我不能让他做任何更多的事情。"

"Okay—then let's be outrageous. What's the most outrageous thing you could think of to ask him for, something you're absolutely sure he'll never do?"

"好吧——那么让我们变得出格。你能想到向他要求的最出格的事情是什么，你绝对确定他永远不会做的事情？"

"There were some stocks in the divorce settlement. He's supposed to sign them over to me, but it's not worth braving one of his terrifying outbursts to get them."

"在离婚协议中有一些股票。他应该把它们签给我，但为了得到它们而勇敢面对他可怕的爆发是不值得的。"

"Sorry, Ruth, but that Ask is nowhere near outrageous enough! You're still in the realm of what he actually owes you. If he was the ex-husband you wanted him to be, and if you knew he had no choice but to say yes, what would be the most outrageous thing you could think of to ask?"

"抱歉，露丝，但那个要求远不够出格！你仍然在他实际欠你的范围内。如果他是你想要他成为的前夫，如果你知道他没有选择只能说'是'，你能想到的最出格的事情是什么？"

"I'd ask him to buy me and the kids a house."

"我会要求他给我和孩子们买一栋房子。"

With that, I could see that Ruth's rage was spent: what was present instead was sadness, and the impossibility of that request ever coming true. Sadness moves our attention inward, which is why it is a powerful gateway to the submissive state. To encourage her body to follow the movement of her attention, I asked her to get on her knees.

就这样，我可以看到露丝的愤怒耗尽了：取而代之的是悲伤，以及那个请求永远不可能成真的不可能性。悲伤把我们的注意力向内移动，这就是为什么它是进入顺从状态的强大门户。为了鼓励她的身体跟随她注意力的运动，我要求她跪下。

"Kneel in front of that fucker?" A final burst of rage.

"跪在那个混蛋面前？"最后一次愤怒爆发。

"Do it, thinking about the house and the kids."

"做吧，想着房子和孩子们。"

She kneeled, looking uncomfortable, so I told her to close her eyes and do a quick version of the Legitimacy exercise: "Tell me about the house. Somehow, miraculously, you got that house; you asked, and he bought you your dream house. What do you feel in your body now that you have it? What are the emotions that come up; what does it make possible?"

她跪下了，看起来不舒服，所以我告诉她闭上眼睛，做一个快速版本的正当性练习："告诉我关于房子的事。不知何故，奇迹般地，你得到了那栋房子；你要求了，他给你买了你梦想中的房子。现在你拥有它，你在身体中感觉到了什么？出现了什么情绪；它使什么成为可能？"

"I feel strong and soft. I feel a burst of enthusiasm. The kids live closer to school, cutting our commute time, which means I have extra hours every day to myself to focus on my writing. It also means I get to move out of the narrow-minded religious community that defined my marriage, so that I'm surrounded by people who think like me. There are new friends I can make, things I can learn. I have a space where I'm going to start teaching writing workshops again, and do the coaching that I know uses my greatest strengths. The kids are closer to their friends. They're happier, and can spend more time out of the house."

"我感到强壮和柔软。我感到一阵热情。孩子们住得更靠近学校，减少了我们的通勤时间，这意味着我每天有额外的时间给自己专注于我的写作。这也意味着我可以搬出定义我婚姻的狭隘宗教社区，这样我就被像我一样思考的人包围。我可以结交新朋友，学习新东西。我有一个空间，我将再次开始教授写作工作坊，并进行我知道利用我最强项的指导。孩子们更靠近他们的朋友。他们更快乐，可以花更多时间在外面。"

The more time we spend here, the more the possibilities expand.

我们在这里花费的时间越多，可能性就越多。

"Now that he's done this," I ask her, "how do you feel about him? How has his role changed, in your eyes?"

"现在他已经这样做了，"我问她，"你对他感觉如何？在你眼中，他的角色如何改变了？"

She says, "He just went from deadbeat dad to the protector and provider I think he always wanted to be in our marriage—but he never knew how."

她说，"他刚刚从一个不负责任的父亲变成了保护者和提供者，我认为他在我们的婚姻中一直想成为这样的人——但他从来不知道如何做到。"

I tell her to stand, and I don't even need to prompt her: she is both soft and powerful as she asks. "You love your kids. You tried your best. You wanted to show up as a real man. You can do something phenomenal for your family now. Buy us a house, and provide safety, security, shelter for us. You can become the man you always wanted to be."

我告诉她站起来，我甚至不需要提示她：当她问时，她既柔软又强大。"你爱你的孩子。你尽力了。你想作为一个真正的男人出现。现在你可以为你的家庭做一些非凡的事情。给我们买一栋房子，为我们提供安全、保障、庇护。你可以成为你一直想成为的男人。"

Then she turns to me and says, "But I don't want to deal with the details—finding the house, all of that."

然后她转向我说，"但我不想处理细节——找房子，所有那些。"

I ask, "Is he good at that?"

我问，"他擅长那个吗？"

"Yes—he's an accountant. Details are his thing."

"是的——他是会计师。细节是他的强项。"

"So tell him."

"那就告诉他。"

She leans into the volunteer, taking the riding crop from my hand. "You are excellent at handling all the boring technical details. You're going to find the house, deal with the real estate agent, set up all the payments and make them. You're going to show me the house once, just before the paperwork is final. It's going to be in the neighborhood I choose, with the features that are important to me. And you're going to change all of our lives."

她向志愿者靠去，从我手中接过马鞭。"你非常擅长处理所有无聊的技术细节。你要去找房子，与房地产经纪人打交道，设置所有付款并支付它们。你要给我看一次房子，就在文件最终确定之前。它将在我选择的社区，具有对我重要的特征。你将改变我们所有人的生活。"

She sits back down across from the volunteer for her final Ask. Before she speaks, she pauses, and I know what she's thinking: we went from four thousand dollars to a house, and still, she's beginning to wonder if this Ask is really so outrageous after all. "Just ask," I say. She does. Her body is calm, her voice is clear, and what shows up for the first time is the love she has for him, hidden underneath all that rage and fear.

她坐回志愿者对面的椅子上，准备她的最后要求。在她说话之前，她停顿了一下，我知道她在想什么：我们从四千美元到一栋房子，而且，她开始怀疑这个要求是否真的如此出格。"就问吧，"我说。她问了。她的身体平静，声音清晰，第一次出现的是她对他的爱，隐藏在所有这些愤怒和恐惧之下。

Three months later, they have a closing date set for the house he is in contract to buy for her. She writes me in disbelief over how four thousand dollars felt like too much, but asking for a house started this brand-new relationship with a man she'd known for twenty years. She forwards me the pictures he's been sending her, of renovation possibilities. This is not the man she divorced; this is the man she glimpsed on their wedding day. With an Ask, she changed his role; in this different role, she has no problem getting him to show up.

三个月后，他们为他为她购买房子的合同设定了成交日期。她写信给我，难以置信地说四千美元感觉太多了，但要求一栋房子开始了她与一个她认识二十年的男人的全新关系。她转发给我他一直发给她的图片，关于翻新的可能性。这不是她离婚的那个人；这是她在婚礼那天瞥见的男人。用一个要求，她改变了他的角色；在这个不同的角色中，她让他出现没有问题。

Here's another:

这里是另一个：

Valentina, a bohemian woman in her forties, gets up to do the Three-Way Ask: she hasn't been able to find a way to request that her dear friend—a wealthy, elderly man—include her in his will.

瓦伦蒂娜，一个四十多岁的波西米亚女人，站起来做三方要求：她一直无法找到一种方式来请求她亲爱的朋友——一个富有、年长的男人——把她列入他的遗嘱。

As she says this, I feel the whole room bristle: Why on earth does she think she has the right to ask a man who isn't related to her to leave her his estate? Her desire is easy to judge, but I know better. First of all, she has no say in what she wants, and, as we are about to discover, this desire has arisen for good reason.

当她这样说时，我感觉到整个房间都在躁动：她到底为什么认为她有权利要求一个与她无关的男人把他的遗产留给她？她的欲望很容易评判，但我更清楚。首先，她对她想要什么没有发言权，而且，正如我们即将发现的，这个欲望是有充分理由的。

For her first, raw version of the Ask, she sits across from him, tells him that she loves him and that he's the only man who has ever felt like a father to her, and asks simply to be added to the will. She does not say that she wants him to leave her everything, but the love I know she feels for him feels wrong when it's spoken in the same sentence as his implied death and a money conversation they haven't yet had.

对于她第一次、原始版本的要求，她坐在他对面，告诉他她爱他，他是唯一一个让她感到像父亲一样的男人，并简单地要求被添加到遗嘱中。她没有说她希望他把一切都留给她，但当我知道她对他的爱在与他的隐含死亡和他们尚未进行的金钱对话同一句话中说出来时，感觉不对。

The Ask feels off—icky.

这个要求感觉不对——令人讨厌。

I have her get on her knees in front of the volunteer, and go inward. She begins talking about how much it means to her that his money backed her to form a theater company, of which she is the director.

我让她在志愿者面前跪下，向内走。她开始谈论他的钱支持她成立一个她担任导演的剧院公司对她意味着什么。

I stop her: "Wait! This is about a job?"

我阻止她："等等！这是关于工作吗？"

She says, "Yes. But the money doesn't really matter to me, so I never thought of it that way." Suddenly, she starts to cry. She says—to me, not to him in the form of the male volunteer: "The last thing on earth I'm going to want to think about when he dies is that I've lost my job, and that this beautiful thing that we created together is also gone. It will be a triple loss."

她说，"是的。但钱对我来说真的不重要，所以我从未这样想过。"突然，她开始哭泣。她说——对我，不是对他以男性志愿者的形式："当他死时，我在地球上最不想想的是我失去了我的工作，我们共同创造的这件美丽的东西也消失了。这将是一个三重损失。"

With that, she's made a powerful statement about what she doesn't want. I ask her what she does want, and in a beautifully vulnerable voice, she tells him: "I want to go to your funeral with the entire theater company, and for all of us to speak about the impact you've had on our lives. I want to cry about the father I've lost with people to whom you are also a father figure. I want us to toast the legacy you've created, strengthened in the knowledge that we will continue the work you've continued."

就这样，她对她不想要的东西做了一个强有力的声明。我问她她想要什么，她用一种美丽的脆弱声音告诉他："我想和整个剧院公司一起去参加你的葬礼，让我们所有人谈论你对我们的生活产生的影响。我想和那些你也作为父亲形象的人一起为我失去的父亲哭泣。我想让我们为你创造的遗产干杯，在我们将继续你继续的工作的知识中得到加强。"

Suddenly, she pops up: "Oh! And I want the house, too."

突然，她跳起来："哦！我也想要房子。"

It feels like a non sequitur, but I follow it: "Why? What's up with the house?" "Oh, that's where the actors live—we're an intentional community." This community, then, is another, uncounted loss that would accompany his death. "And you're in charge of all of this?" I ask. "Yes. It's my life purpose. I never think of it as a job, even though I do get paid. That's why I never thought about how important the money would be, if we wanted to keep his vision going."

这感觉像是一个不合逻辑的推论，但我跟随它："为什么？房子怎么了？" "哦，那是演员住的地方——我们是一个有意社区。"那么这个社区是另一个，未计算的损失，将伴随他的死亡。"你负责所有这一切吗？"我问。"是的。这是我的人生目标。我从不认为这是一份工作，即使我确实得到报酬。这就是为什么我从未想过如果我们想保持他的愿景继续，钱会有多重要。"

Now I have Valentina stand. I ask her to make "you" statements, to put her attention outward. She stands over the volunteer: "You're the only father I've ever known. You're the benefactor, the one who made this beautiful artistic community we created together possible. This is your exquisite contribution to this world and you want it to outlive you, to grow even after you are gone. Charge me with the protection of your legacy. Set up your will so this work can continue, so that it can stand as your gift to humanity."

现在我让瓦伦蒂娜站起来。我要求她做"你"的陈述，把注意力向外。她站在志愿者上方："你是我唯一认识的父亲。你是恩人，是使我们一起创造的这个美丽艺术社区成为可能的人。这是你对这个世界的精致贡献，你希望它超越你，在你离开后继续成长。委托我保护你的遗产。建立你的遗嘱，以便这项工作可以继续，这样它可以作为你给人类的礼物。"

Quickly, I want her to get on her knees again; I want her to say to him what she said to me: "I don't want to suffer the loss of you, the most important person in my world, and my life purpose on the same day. I want to be protected from that experience. I want to be the protector of your legacy. I want you to live on in this form. Will you put me in your will? I want to inherit the money, not just to keep this going, but to grow it so that it becomes what we always dreamed."

很快，我想让她再次跪下；我想让她对他说她对我说的："我不想在同一天遭受失去你——我世界上最重要的人——和我的人生目标的痛苦。我想被保护免受那种经历。我想成为你遗产的保护者。我希望你以这种形式继续存在。你会把我列入你的遗嘱吗？我想继承这笔钱，不仅仅是为了保持这个继续，而是为了成长它，使它成为我们一直梦想的样子。"

Now the whole room feels it: that seemingly Outrageous Ask wasn't so crazy after all. It sounded at first like she was making a greedy grab for his cash; now we understand exactly why he would agree to what she's asking. She sits in the chair across from the volunteer, and I say, "Go ahead and ask, however it occurs to you."

现在整个房间都感受到了：那个看似出格的要求毕竟不是那么疯狂。起初听起来像是她在贪婪地抓取他的现金；现在我们完全理解为什么他会同意她要求的东西。她坐在志愿者对面的椅子上，我说，"继续问吧，无论它如何出现在你脑海中。"

In three simple sentences, she asks him to leave her his estate. The Ask is filled with such love, clarity, power, and total legitimacy that it's impossible to imagine him saying no.

用三个简单的句子，她要求他把他的遗产留给她。这个要求充满了如此的爱、清晰、力量和完全的正当性，以至于无法想象他会说不。

And, as she reports back a few weeks later, he doesn't say no—he says yes, and more. In fact, her breathtakingly inappropriate, shockingly forward, greedy Outrageous Ask turned out to be too conservative. After the Ask, her mentor also formed a foundation, which will fund the company in perpetuity. Valentina is artistic director for as long as she'd like to be, and the foundation is also funding a residency in New Zealand, where she can take two weeks a year to steep herself in the most beautiful nature in the world while she develops new talent.

而且，正如她在几周后报告的那样，他没有说不——他说是，而且更多。事实上，她令人难以置信的不合适、令人震惊的前进、贪婪的出格要求结果证明太保守了。在要求之后，她的导师还成立了一个基金会，将永久资助公司。瓦伦蒂娜可以想当多久的艺术总监就多久，基金会还在资助新西兰的一个驻地，她每年可以在那里花两周时间沉浸在世界上最美丽的自然中，同时发展新的人才。

### Is Your Ask Outrageous Enough? | 你的要求足够出格吗？

The question I always have about a seemingly Outrageous Ask is: Who are you to judge your desires? With what faculty do you designate a desire as outrageous? Is it more outrageous to demand change, or to go along with the warped and twisted world we live in?

关于一个看似出格的要求，我总是有一个问题：你是谁，凭什么评判你的欲望？你用什么能力来指定一个欲望是出格的？要求改变更出格，还是与我们生活的扭曲世界一起走更出格？

Sometimes the pure desire behind an Outrageous Ask is actually sanity.

有时，出格要求背后的纯欲望实际上是理智的。

I've never met a woman who wasn't carrying a desire in her heart that could change the world as we know it. I teach so that women can break the bonds that constrain them, and so they can have a powerful influence in shaping our individual worlds. But my students have shown me that we can go much, much further than that.

我从未遇到过不在心中怀有可以改变我们所知世界的欲望的女人。我教书是为了让女性能够打破束缚她们的枷锁，这样她们就能在塑造我们的个人世界中产生强大的影响力。但我的学生向我展示了我们可以走得更远、更远。

The outrageous desire that lives in your being only seems outrageous because of the skewed world we live in.

生活在你的存在中的出格欲望只是因为我们生活的扭曲世界而显得出格。

Once upon a time, in the not-so-recent past, a woman went to her superior and said, "Here's the deal: I'm going to have a baby. I want you to continue paying me while I have my baby, even though I won't be working. Then I'd like to spend some time at home with the baby, and I would like you to pay me while I do that. Later, I would like to return to my position, with the same salary."

从前，在不太遥远的过去，一个女人去找她的上级说："这是交易：我要生一个孩子。我希望你在我有孩子时继续付我工资，即使我不会工作。然后我想和宝宝在家里待一段时间，我希望你在我这样做时付我工资。之后，我想回到我的职位，同样的薪水。"

It's likely that this Ask sounded selfish, greedy, outrageous—insane, even. Yet now maternity leave is an accepted part of working life for many women. (Though not enough!) We see its stupendous benefits for women and children and families and society at large.

很可能这个要求听起来自私、贪婪、出格——甚至疯狂。然而现在，产假是许多女性工作生活中被接受的一部分。（虽然还不够！）我们看到了它对女性、儿童、家庭和整个社会的巨大好处。

So I'd ask you to double-check your selfish, outrageous desires and the Asks that would make them come true. You have the skills you need to have those difficult conversations. Is your desire more outrageous than Rosa Parks's was? Or Susan B. Anthony's? Or Malala Yousafzai's? Or Greta Thunberg's?

所以我想请你仔细检查你的自私、出格的欲望和将使它们成真的要求。你有进行那些困难对话所需的技能。你的欲望比罗莎·帕克斯的更出格吗？还是苏珊·B·安东尼的？还是马拉拉·优素福扎伊的？还是格蕾塔·桑伯格的？

Every one of these women was willing to acknowledge the enormity and the truth of the life force they carried. So before you censor yourself, talk yourself down, negotiate against yourself: Ask. Does your burning desire—your Outrageous Ask—carry the cure for what's wrong with our world?

这些女人中的每一个都愿意承认她们携带的生命力的巨大和真实。所以在你审查自己、说服自己、与自己谈判之前：问。你燃烧的欲望——你出格的要求——是否携带了治愈我们世界问题的良方？
