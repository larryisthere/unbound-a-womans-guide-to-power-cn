# Chapter 01: THE CONVERSATION UNDER THE CONVERSATION | 第一章：对话之下的对话

## The Hidden Architecture of Power | 隐藏的权力架构

Women are furious.

女性们愤怒了。

Instead of frolicking through fields of equal pay and the state-funded child care our feminist foremothers fought for, we're hanging on by shredded fingernails to rapidly eroding fundamental rights. Sexual assault doesn't seem to disqualify a man from public office; instead, they brag about it like it's a qualification. And every news cycle seems to bring a fresh story featuring our girl children, trafficked for the pleasure of wealthy, powerful men and covered up by their cronies.

我们没有在平等薪酬和国家资助的托儿服务中欢欣鼓舞——这些是我们的女权主义前辈们为之奋斗的——而是用破碎的指甲紧紧抓住迅速侵蚀的基本权利。性侵犯似乎不会让一个男人失去公职资格；相反，他们像炫耀资格一样吹嘘它。每一个新闻周期似乎都会带来新的故事，讲述我们的女孩被贩卖给富有、有权势的男人取乐，并被他们的同伙掩盖。

We know that it has never been more important for us to speak—to be able to communicate the truth of our experiences, to ask for what we want, to be able to articulate our vision for the future we want to live in, and then make that vision happen.

我们知道，对我们来说，说话从来没有像现在这样重要——能够传达我们经历的真实情况，提出我们想要的东西，能够表达我们对想要生活的未来的愿景，然后让这个愿景成为现实。

And yet what I hear most from women is self-blame.

然而，我从女性那里听到最多的是自责。

Truly badass women tell me about freezing—moments when they know they should say something, moments when they need to say something, or maybe it's too many things, but when they open their mouths, nothing comes out. Sometimes this freeze happens in high-stakes scenarios, when a job or their safety is on the line. On one hand, this makes it worse, and certainly more dangerous; by the time they've returned to their bodies, his hand is up their skirt, the job has gone to someone else, or they've agreed to do something they really didn't want to do.

真正强大的女性告诉我关于冻结——她们知道应该说些什么的时刻，她们需要说些什么的时刻，或者可能是太多事情，但当她们张开嘴时，什么也说不出来。有时这种冻结发生在高风险的情况下，当工作或她们的安全受到威胁时。一方面，这让情况变得更糟，当然也更危险；当她们回到自己的身体时，他的手已经伸进了她们的裙子，工作已经给了别人，或者她们已经同意做一些她们真的不想做的事情。

But on the other hand, they can't understand why it happens in ultra-low-stakes scenarios, too—like when the guy making their latte asks if they're single. And why can't they predict when this speechlessness is going to set in?

但另一方面，她们无法理解为什么它也会发生在超低风险的情况下——比如当给她们做拿铁的男人问她们是否单身时。为什么她们无法预测这种失语何时会发生？

Baffled women confess that they don't know which version of themselves is going to show up for a meeting. Will it be the deer in the headlights, peeling herself off the conference room floor only to get steamrolled again—the one who mumbles a brilliant idea into her mug, just so the guy next to her can helpfully restate it and take the credit? Or the fearless Amazon who effortlessly holds the room in the palm of her hand, whose logic and charisma make her so irresistible, she could ask her team to ride to hell and back? Mansplainers and manterrupters exist in every workplace; so how come she's mostly able to neutralize those guys with a cocked eyebrow—except on the days when she sounds like a harsh, bitter shrew, even to herself?

困惑的女性承认，她们不知道哪个版本的自己会出现在会议上。会是那个在车灯前惊慌失措的鹿，从会议室地板上爬起来，结果又被碾压——那个把绝妙的想法喃喃自语到杯子里，只是为了让她旁边的男人能够"帮助"地重述并抢走功劳？还是那个无畏的亚马逊，轻松地将整个房间掌握在手中，她的逻辑和魅力让她如此不可抗拒，她可以让她的团队下地狱再回来？每个工作场所都有男性说教者和男性打断者；那么为什么她大多能够用一个挑眉来中和那些家伙——除了那些她听起来像是一个严厉、刻薄的泼妇的日子，即使对她自己来说也是如此？

I can—and have—filled pages with women's bewilderments:

我可以——也确实——用女性的困惑填满页面：

"I was just about to ask this guy to help me with my stroller on the stairs—but when he offered to help me, I heard myself saying, 'No, that's okay; I'm fine.'"

"我正要请这个人帮我在楼梯上拿婴儿车——但当他要帮助我时，我听到自己说，'不，没关系；我很好。'"

"When my boyfriend said he wanted a night alone, I got so depressed, I went straight to bed. I knew he just wanted to play his new video game, but I still felt completely annihilated; it felt like he was rejecting me."

"当我的男朋友说他想要一个独自的夜晚时，我变得如此沮丧，直接上床睡觉了。我知道他只是想玩他的新电子游戏，但我仍然感到完全被摧毁；感觉就像他在拒绝我。"

"When the holy day came, and my boss finally asked me exactly what resources I needed to complete a major project on time, why did I only give him half of my list?"

"当那个重要的日子到来，我的老板终于问我到底需要什么资源才能按时完成一个重大项目时，为什么我只给了他清单的一半？"

A recent study showed that women who knew the average salary for a job proceeded to ask for less than that when they were negotiating for themselves. Another study: many women find it much more challenging to ask for a raise than to remain catastrophically underpaid. And another: women wait to be 100 percent qualified for management positions, whereas men don't hesitate to apply—which at least explains why so many women end up answering to less-qualified men.

最近的一项研究表明，知道工作平均工资的女性在为自己谈判时，会要求低于这个数字。另一项研究：许多女性发现要求加薪比保持灾难性的低薪更具挑战性。还有一项：女性等待100%符合管理职位资格，而男性毫不犹豫地申请——这至少解释了为什么这么多女性最终要向资格较差的男性汇报。

At first blush, the items on this laundry list may seem unrelated except in the most general sense—"women getting in their own way." But, in fact, every one of these is a symptom of the same underlying cause. And that cause is not insecurity, or childhood trauma, or women loving themselves less than men do; indeed, these paradoxes show up in the lives of the most therapized, self-actualized, self-loving women I know.

乍一看，这个清单上的项目可能看起来不相关，除了最一般的意义——"女性自己阻碍自己"。但实际上，每一个都是同一根本原因的症状。这个原因不是不安全感，不是童年创伤，也不是女性爱自己不如男性多；事实上，这些矛盾出现在我认识的最受治疗、最自我实现、最自爱的女性的生活中。

In fact, what appears to be a confidence gap could be considered yet another symptom of this underlying problem. Of course it is fundamentally destabilizing to realize that we can't trust ourselves to reliably, consistently, effectively advocate for ourselves, and to know that speechlessness may ambush us at any time, no matter how prepared we are.

事实上，看似信心差距的东西可以被视为这个根本问题的另一个症状。当然，意识到我们不能信任自己可靠、一致、有效地为自己辩护，知道失语可能随时袭击我们，无论我们准备得多么充分，这从根本上是不稳定的。

The mystery isn't solved by a big-picture concept like sexism, either, though there's no shortage of evidence that misogyny is alive and well. Actually, it's good news that sexism isn't the culprit, because it means we don't have to wait to dismantle the patriarchy to put our hands on the levers of power, to dispel those confusions, and to learn to trust ourselves.

这个谜题也不能通过像性别歧视这样的大概念来解决，尽管有大量证据表明厌女症仍然存在并且很活跃。实际上，好消息是性别歧视不是罪魁祸首，因为这意味着我们不必等待拆除父权制来掌握权力杠杆，消除那些困惑，并学会信任自己。

Every one of the bewilderments listed above took place—and could have been resolved—in a single moment during a conversation between people. In that one moment, a woman could not speak, or speak as effectively as she needed to. Which also means that if we can reclaim those moments, then we don't have to search for a psychological solution to these problems, or to wait until we've fixed the culture from the ground up.

上面列出的每一个困惑都发生在——并且可能已经解决——人们之间对话的单一时刻。在那一刻，一个女人无法说话，或者无法像她需要的那样有效地说话。这也意味着，如果我们能够重新获得那些时刻，那么我们就不必寻找这些问题的心理解决方案，也不必等到我们从根本上修复文化。

The whole world is built on agreements, born from the conversations that happen inside relationships. All the seemingly fixed phenomena that surround us—from love to laws, from families to corporations to governments—are the direct result of an agreement. Private property is an agreement. So is monogamy, the nuclear family, the dictates of major religions, and our justice system. Even money is a collective agreement.

整个世界都建立在协议之上，这些协议产生于关系中发生的对话。所有围绕我们的看似固定的现象——从爱到法律，从家庭到公司到政府——都是协议的直接结果。私有财产是一个协议。一夫一妻制、核心家庭、主要宗教的指令和我们的司法系统也是如此。甚至金钱也是一个集体协议。

Many of those agreements were made without any women at all involved in the conversations that gave rise to them. We're at the table now, though—and this is why we must be able to have these conversations, reliably and well.

许多这些协议是在没有任何女性参与产生它们的对话的情况下制定的。不过，我们现在在桌边了——这就是为什么我们必须能够可靠、良好地进行这些对话。

So what is it that stands in our way?

那么，是什么阻碍了我们？

There is a set of mechanics, invisible to most of us, but consistent in every conversation, whether high stakes or low. These mechanics determine who has control—who leads, who follows, what is under discussion, and where the conversation will go next. The conditioning that women receive from earliest childhood makes access to these mechanics infuriatingly, and sometimes dangerously, unpredictable.

有一套机制，对我们大多数人来说是看不见的，但在每次对话中都是一致的，无论是高风险还是低风险。这些机制决定了谁有控制权——谁领导，谁跟随，讨论什么，以及对话下一步将走向何方。女性从最早童年开始接受的条件反射使得对这些机制的访问令人愤怒，有时甚至是危险的不可预测。

These mechanics are invisible to men, too; this isn't one of those times they "forgot" to invite us to the meeting. But because men are trained and conditioned differently, they have easier automatic access to these levers, even if they don't have the slightest idea how they work. (Most people don't know how a carburetor works either.) The invisibility of those mechanics, and of the conditioning that gives men access to them, also explains why even the very best ones can't really understand why we get tripped up.

这些机制对男性来说也是看不见的；这不是他们"忘记"邀请我们参加会议的时候之一。但因为男性的训练和条件反射不同，他们更容易自动访问这些杠杆，即使他们完全不知道它们是如何工作的。（大多数人也不知道化油器是如何工作的。）这些机制的不可见性，以及让男性能够访问它们的条件反射，也解释了为什么即使是最好的男性也无法真正理解我们为什么会绊倒。

But the cost for women is devastating. In fact, you could argue that the invisibility of these mechanics has resulted in a giant, culture-wide gaslighting for half the population.

但对女性来说，代价是毁灭性的。事实上，你可以争辩说，这些机制的不可见性导致了文化范围内对一半人口的巨大煤气灯效应。

But before we can talk about how power works, we have to talk about what it is—and what it's not.

但在我们谈论权力如何运作之前，我们必须谈论它是什么——以及它不是什么。

### A Practical Definition of Power | 权力的实用定义

"I want to be able to stand in my strength," women tell me when I ask what they want. "I want to feel powerful." "I need to build my confidence." "I have to find my voice."

"我想能够站在我的力量中，"当我在问她们想要什么时，女性告诉我。"我想感到强大。""我需要建立我的信心。""我必须找到我的声音。"

These urges are valuable. They contain the germ of what I call "choiceless choices"—the desires we harbor that cannot be ignored. And we can do this; we can unroll our yoga mats, get our journals out, and recite affirmations all day long. I'll be right there with you, and I guarantee we'll have a great day, and end up feeling better rested than we have in years.

这些冲动是有价值的。它们包含了我称之为"无选择的选择"的萌芽——我们怀有的无法忽视的欲望。我们可以这样做；我们可以展开瑜伽垫，拿出日记本，整天背诵肯定语。我会和你在一起，我保证我们会度过美好的一天，最终感觉比多年来休息得更好。

But that's not power.

但这不是权力。

---

Power isn't a feeling. Power is **influence**, which means it must take place in a dynamic.

权力不是一种感觉。权力是**影响力**，这意味着它必须在动态中发生。

---

You'll note that I use the word "influence," as opposed to "control." What I am describing is not an imposition of will. To control another human being's behavior without making sure that they're on board—without their heart, their intelligence, their imagination, their ingenuity—is a terrible waste. Control squanders a tremendous amount of energy for comparatively very little reward. And, as every dictator knows, tyranny is fundamentally unstable; you're always going to need more capital, more control, more suppression to stay on top. Inevitably, the revolution comes.

你会注意到我使用"影响力"这个词，而不是"控制"。我描述的不是意志的强加。在没有确保他们参与的情况下控制另一个人的行为——没有他们的心、他们的智慧、他们的想象力、他们的创造力——是一种可怕的浪费。控制浪费了大量的能量，而回报相对很少。而且，正如每个独裁者都知道的那样，暴政从根本上是不稳定的；你总是需要更多的资本、更多的控制、更多的压制来保持领先。不可避免地，革命会到来。

Influence is the opposite of control. If you are able to powerfully influence someone, then you gain access to all of their inner resources: their smarts, their creativity, their passion. This kind of cooperation often creates a third possibility, a solution even better than either person involved could possibly have imagined by themselves.

影响力是控制的对立面。如果你能够有力地影响某人，那么你就可以获得他们所有的内在资源：他们的智慧、他们的创造力、他们的激情。这种合作往往创造出第三种可能性，一个比任何参与的人都可能自己想象的更好的解决方案。

So the kind of power I'm talking about is generative, not destructive, but it does mean being able to ask people for all kinds of things, including for what you want. (We are going to talk a lot about asking in this book.) Power means doing, and receiving.

所以我谈论的这种权力是生成性的，不是破坏性的，但它确实意味着能够向人们要求各种东西，包括你想要的东西。（我们将在这本书中大量谈论要求。）权力意味着行动和接收。

Which is why power requires us to control the direction of the conversation. This might mean deploying the verbal jujitsu necessary to get the hell out of the hotel room, if that's what's required. Or deflecting a question you're not ready to answer, or keeping the topic focused on your concerns, despite someone else's discomfort or insistence on another direction. Ultimately, it means being able to move another person—staying curious in the face of someone else's entrenched resistance, and staying with your desire until they change their minds.

这就是为什么权力要求我们控制对话的方向。这可能意味着部署必要的语言柔术来离开酒店房间，如果这是需要的话。或者转移一个你还没有准备好回答的问题，或者保持话题专注于你的关注点，尽管其他人不舒服或坚持另一个方向。最终，这意味着能够移动另一个人——在面对他人根深蒂固的阻力时保持好奇，并坚持你的欲望直到他们改变主意。

When students come to me talking about wanting to "feel" empowered, I ask them to tell me what they would do if they felt that way. "What would it look like, if you were more confident? Would you make an appointment with your accountant to open the stack of unpaid medical bills you've been ignoring for six months? Would you finally break up with the person you've been dating because you're no longer afraid of being alone? Would you name your childhood abuser? Would you embark on an all-female polar expedition?"

当学生们来找我谈论想要"感觉"被赋权时，我问她们，如果她们有那种感觉，她们会做什么。"如果你更自信，会是什么样子？你会和你的会计师预约，打开你六个月来一直忽视的那堆未付医疗账单吗？你会最终和你一直在约会的人分手，因为你不再害怕独处吗？你会说出你童年虐待者的名字吗？你会开始一次全女性的极地探险吗？"

Of course, there are as many answers as there are women in the room, but the question breaks the spell. Instead of wandering the wilderness, hoping that we'll stumble onto the magic formula that delivers us into our own power, we can start to refine these vague, amorphous inclinations into concrete desires. And then we can formulate the skillful conversations that will get our bosses, our partners, our enemies, and our friends to participate in the creation of a new reality that will satisfy those desires.

当然，房间里有多少女性就有多少答案，但这个问题打破了魔咒。与其在荒野中徘徊，希望我们会偶然发现将我们带入自己力量的魔法公式，我们可以开始将这些模糊、无定形的倾向提炼成具体的欲望。然后我们可以制定巧妙的对话，让我们的老板、我们的伴侣、我们的敌人和我们的朋友参与创造一个能够满足这些欲望的新现实。

As you will see, it's crucially important for every one of us to identify our own deepest inner signal, to locate and feel what is alive in us. But it's not enough to feel it. We have to be able to speak it, to express it, and to make it show up—in our relationships, in our workplaces, in the world.

正如你将看到的，对我们每个人来说，识别我们自己最深层的内在信号，定位和感受我们体内有活力的东西，是至关重要的。但仅仅感受它是不够的。我们必须能够说出来，表达它，并让它出现——在我们的关系中，在我们的工作场所，在世界上。

You know when you're really going to feel like you're strong and powerful? When you can rely on yourself to speak, no matter how inappropriate the question or how badly it triggers you. When you can navigate another person's opposition to your ideas with generosity and skill, recognizing it as an opportunity for intimacy or access to critical information instead of seeing it as a slammed door. When you can ask anyone for anything, and greet even the hardest no with a sense of humor and persistence and curiosity.

你知道你什么时候真的会感到强大和有力量吗？当你能够依靠自己说话时，无论问题多么不合适，或者它多么严重地触发你。当你能够以慷慨和技巧应对他人对你想法的反对，将其视为亲密或获取关键信息的机会，而不是将其视为一扇被关上的门。当你能够向任何人要求任何东西，并以幽默、坚持和好奇来迎接甚至最困难的"不"时。

When you can do this, you're not going to need power poses or advice on how much jewelry to wear with your pantsuit if you want to be taken seriously. You're going to feel exactly as confident as you should—and everyone else is going to feel it, too.

当你能做到这一点时，如果你想要被认真对待，你就不需要权力姿势或关于穿多少珠宝配你的裤装的建议。你会感到完全应该有的自信——其他人也会感受到。

### Turning the Spotlight: Exposing the Hidden Levers of Power | 转向聚光灯：揭示隐藏的权力杠杆

Cue drumroll: It's time to pull back the curtain to expose the inner workings of power—to make the invisible visible, to throw flour on the ghost.

鼓声响起：是时候拉开帷幕，暴露权力的内部运作——让不可见的东西可见，在鬼魂上撒面粉。

To do this, I'm going to teach you a technique called "Turning the Spotlight." This technique will get you off the spot when you're frozen, regardless of the circumstances or the stakes. It works equally well when a stranger asks when you're planning to have a baby as it does in the moment after a movie mogul has thrown open his bathrobe.

为此，我将教你一种叫做"转向聚光灯"的技巧。这种技巧会在你被冻结时让你摆脱困境，无论情况或风险如何。当陌生人问你计划什么时候要孩子时，它同样有效，就像电影大亨敞开他的浴袍后的那一刻一样。

This technique will take you ten seconds to learn, and while it may take you a little longer to master—we do have millennia's worth of conditioning to contend with, after all—that's okay. We're going to spend the rest of this book getting you in fighting shape.

这种技巧需要你十秒钟来学习，虽然你可能需要更长的时间来掌握——毕竟，我们确实有数千年的条件反射要应对——但这没关系。我们将在这本书的其余部分让你进入战斗状态。

Here it is: The next time you find yourself speechless and on the spot, opening and closing your mouth like a goldfish without the slightest idea what to do or say next—Ask a question.

就是这样：下次你发现自己失语并在现场，像金鱼一样张开和闭上嘴，完全不知道下一步该做什么或说什么——问一个问题。

Don't explain yourself; don't justify your position—simply ask the other person a question about themselves. It doesn't have to be a witty zinger, or a setup for Katharine Hepburn–style repartee. In fact, it can be a complete non sequitur: "Do you swim with sharks?" or "Where'd you get that tie?"

不要解释自己；不要为你的立场辩护——只需问对方一个关于他们自己的问题。它不必是一个机智的妙语，也不必是为凯瑟琳·赫本式机智对话设置的。事实上，它可以是一个完全不合逻辑的问题："你和鲨鱼一起游泳吗？"或"你在哪里买的那条领带？"

A single question will break the freeze. To go one step further, swinging the spotlight so it's shining in his eyes instead—and this is the part that's going to take a little training—ask another question. And another one. And another. Don't stop until you've got him where you want him.

一个问题会打破冻结。更进一步，摆动聚光灯，让它照在他的眼睛里——这是需要一点训练的部分——再问一个问题。然后再问一个。再问一个。不要停止，直到你让他到达你想要的地方。

That's it.

就是这样。

It works every time. Why and how it works is the story of this book, but I can give you a sneak preview there, too: simply put, Turning the Spotlight works because

它每次都有效。为什么以及它如何运作是这本书的故事，但我也可以给你一个预览：简单地说，转向聚光灯有效是因为

asking a question reverses the flow of attention.

问一个问题会逆转注意力的流动。

And control over the flow of attention is power.

对注意力流动的控制就是权力。

### Animal Bodies, Communicating | 动物身体，沟通交流

I came to this realization about power and attention in an unusual way.

我以一种不寻常的方式得出了关于权力和注意力的这个认识。

I spent seventeen years studying to become a Taoist nun, traveling around the world to study martial arts, Chinese medicine, and alchemical practices with people so knowledgeable and skilled, the work they did seemed like magic. I paid for my studies and travel by working as a professional dominatrix. It was one of the most expansive, beautiful periods of my life.

我花了十七年时间学习成为一名道教修女，周游世界学习武术、中医和炼金术实践，与那些知识渊博、技能高超的人一起，他们所做的工作似乎像魔法一样。我通过作为专业女支配者工作来支付我的学习和旅行费用。这是我生命中最广阔、最美丽的时期之一。

注：女支配者（Dominatrix）。在BDSM文化中，这是指在权力关系中处于主导地位的女性。在本书中，这个概念被用来描述一种心理状态和沟通方式，而不仅仅是性角色。女支配者通过明确的边界、清晰的沟通和自信的表达来建立影响力。

One year, I spent a week in the desert with a martial arts master. Outside his house was a labyrinth made of discarded school desks, piled high into walls. His students had to run through that labyrinth blindfolded, without touching any of the desks. To do this, they had to sharpen their senses, becoming present to every subtle cue, like a wolf running wild through a dark forest.

有一年，我和一位武术大师在沙漠里待了一周。他的房子外面是一个由废弃的学校课桌制成的迷宫，高高堆成墙。他的学生们必须蒙着眼睛跑过那个迷宫，不能碰到任何课桌。要做到这一点，他们必须锐化他们的感官，对每一个微妙的线索保持警觉，就像一只在黑暗森林中奔跑的狼。

After one of these incredible training sessions in the desert, I flew back to New York City to work at the dungeon. Except that it was sleeting, and even the most dedicated submissives won't brave New York's wintry mix. The other women in the lounge balanced Chinese food containers on shiny thigh-high boots and joked about the rom-com on TV, but in my heightened sensory state, their laughter felt abrasive, and the smell of the food nauseated me. So instead of joining in, as I might have a week earlier, I fled to a quiet windowsill where I could be alone.

在沙漠中这些令人难以置信的训练课程之一之后，我飞回纽约市在密室工作。只是当时在下雨夹雪，即使是最专注的被支配者也不会勇敢面对纽约的冬季混合天气。休息室里的其他女性在闪亮的高筒靴上平衡着中餐容器，开着电视上浪漫喜剧的玩笑，但在我高度敏感的状态下，她们的笑声感觉刺耳，食物的味道让我恶心。所以我没有像一周前可能做的那样加入，而是逃到了一个安静的窗台上，在那里我可以独自一人。

注：密室（dungeon）。在BDSM文化中，这是指进行权力游戏和探索的安全空间。在本书中，作者用这个词来指代她作为女支配者工作的专业场所，强调这是一个有边界、有规则、有安全措施的空间。

Sitting there, feeling the cold glass against my skin, absorbed in the surreal transition between my sensory expansion in the desert and the crude realities of the dungeon, I picked up the dog-training book Mistress Josephine had bought to help with her new puppy.

坐在那里，感受着冰冷的玻璃贴着我的皮肤，沉浸在我沙漠中感官扩展和密室粗糙现实之间的超现实过渡中，我拿起了女主人约瑟芬为帮助她的小狗而买的训狗书。

The premise of the book (although I understand the trainer himself is now under some scrutiny for his treatment of both animals and women) is fairly simple: most people make the mistake of treating their dog like he's a human.

这本书的前提（虽然我理解训练师本人现在因对待动物和女性的方式而受到一些审查）相当简单：大多数人犯的错误是把他们的狗当作人类来对待。

Your dog doesn't understand words; he registers what your body and tone communicate. So if you tell him to stop eating the couch in a soft, pleading voice, it reads as praise; he's listening to what your body and tone of voice are saying, not your words. And the message he gets is that he's the alpha, in charge of the pack. Which means you've put him in an impossible situation: how can he lead his pack, feeding them and keeping them safe, when food arrives unpredictably and in bowls, and enemies approach constantly, delivering FedEx packages and pad thai? Also, what the fuck is a couch?

你的狗不理解单词；他记录的是你的身体和语调传达的内容。所以如果你用柔和、恳求的声音告诉他停止吃沙发，这会被解读为赞美；他在听你的身体和语调在说什么，而不是你的话。他得到的信息是他是阿尔法，负责这个群体。这意味着你把他置于一个不可能的境地：当食物不可预测地到达并装在碗里，敌人不断接近，递送联邦快递包裹和泰式炒河粉时，他如何领导他的群体，喂养他们并保护他们的安全？还有，沙发到底是什么？

We think deferring to the dog is a kindness, but all it does is confuse him, setting him up for stress and failure—which is how so many people end up with neurotic dogs.

我们认为顺从狗是一种善意，但它所做的只是让他困惑，让他陷入压力和失败——这就是为什么这么多人最终养了神经质的狗。

But what happens to the vast majority of dogs when an experienced trainer walks into the room?

但是当一位经验丰富的训练师走进房间时，绝大多数狗会发生什么？

They relax.

它们放松了。

It's not what the trainer does or says so much as the way he is. When the animal of his body tells their animal bodies, "I've got this; I'm in charge," they let go of their terrible vigilance.

与其说是训练师做什么或说什么，不如说是他的方式。当他身体的动物告诉它们身体的动物，"我掌握了这个；我负责"时，它们放下了可怕的警惕。

Watch, and you'll see them submit, their bodies softening with relief.

看着，你会看到它们屈服，它们的身体因解脱而软化。

Reading this manual in a dungeon after an entire week of exploring the energy body, it came to me: "This is exactly what I'm doing with these men! They say they want bondage, or a foot-fetish session, but what they really want is to be fully held in somebody else's attention—someone with enough energetic authority that they relax and begin to feel themselves."

在探索能量体整整一周后，在密室里阅读这本手册时，我突然想到："这正是我对这些男人所做的！他们说他们想要束缚，或者恋足癖的课程，但他们真正想要的是完全被别人的注意力所包围——一个有足够能量权威的人，让他们放松并开始感受自己。"

注：被支配者（Sub）。在BDSM文化中，这是指在权力关系中处于顺从地位的个体。在本书中，这个概念被用来描述一种向内关注、深度连接的心理状态。被支配者通过倾听、感受和表达真实需求来建立影响力。

And so, that wet, freezing afternoon, the energetic work I'd been doing in the desert crashed into the energetic work I'd been doing at the dungeon. Josephine's dog-training manual turned out to be the spark required to illuminate a whole new way of seeing for me.

就这样，在那个潮湿、寒冷的下午，我在沙漠中一直在做的能量工作与我一直在密室中做的能量工作碰撞在一起。约瑟芬的训狗手册结果成为了照亮我全新观看方式所需的火花。

What if humans weren't just forgetting that their dogs were animals, but forgetting that other humans are, too? All living creatures communicate, although only humans have language. A huge amount of what we "say" happens nonverbally, and it goes way beyond body language. Energetics are how you know in an instant whether someone is an attacker or a healer, or the way someone's physical presence can soothe or disconcert you, even before they've said a word.

如果人类不仅忘记了他们的狗是动物，而且忘记了其他人也是动物呢？所有生物都会交流，尽管只有人类有语言。我们"说"的很多东西都是非语言的，它远远超出了身体语言。能量学是你如何在一瞬间知道某人是攻击者还是治疗者，或者某人的身体存在如何能够安抚或让你不安，甚至在他们说一句话之前。

What I wondered was: what if we could feel—and meaningfully direct—what our animal bodies were saying to one another?

我想知道的是：如果我们能够感受——并有意义地引导——我们的动物身体在彼此之间说的话呢？

Becoming aware of this primal "conversation under the conversation" is one of the most powerful communication tools we have. We cannot talk over what our bodies are saying to one another. That revelation would prove to be the cornerstone of everything I would do at the school I founded a few years later.

意识到这种原始的"对话之下的对话"是我们拥有的最强大的沟通工具之一。我们不能掩盖我们的身体在彼此之间说的话。这个启示将证明是我几年后创立的学校所做一切的基石。

In a flash, I understood that both the Taoist nuns and dominatrices I most admired were powerful precisely because they could control that conversation under the conversation—and it wasn't through a self-conscious manipulation of their body language. Instead, they did so, just as a successful dog trainer does, with something far more powerful and primal: their attention.

一瞬间，我明白了，我最钦佩的道教修女和女支配者之所以强大，正是因为他们能够控制对话之下的对话——这不是通过对身体语言的自我意识操纵。相反，他们这样做，就像一个成功的训狗师一样，用更强大和原始的东西：他们的注意力。

Power moves with attention.

权力随注意力移动。

What I had been learning in the desert, in the dojo, and in the dungeon, then, could be summed up this way: the art of attention. Attention dictates where the energy is—the juice, the qi, the life force—in any given interaction. It is how our animal bodies communicate with one another. Language is important; so are physical gestures. But more important than both is where the attention is directed.

那么，我在沙漠、道场和密室中学到的东西可以这样总结：注意力的艺术。注意力决定了能量在哪里——精华、气、生命力——在任何给定的互动中。这就是我们的动物身体如何彼此交流。语言很重要；身体手势也是如此。但比两者更重要的是注意力的方向。

This is why real power is available to you whether you're the janitor or the CEO. Skillful awareness and mastery of where your attention is placed—not status, or access to resources, or a title—are what will put your hands on the steering wheel.

这就是为什么真正的权力对你来说是可用的，无论你是看门人还是首席执行官。熟练地意识和掌握你的注意力放在哪里——不是地位，不是资源获取，也不是头衔——这将让你把手放在方向盘上。
