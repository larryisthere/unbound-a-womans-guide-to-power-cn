# Chapter 14: CUTTING THROUGH THE FOG | 第十四章：穿透迷雾

## The Power of Location | 定位的力量

Many stories of harassment and intimidation are straightforward: a man in a position of power unzips his pants and asks a woman how much she wants the job.

许多骚扰和恐吓的故事是直接的：一个有权力的男人拉开拉链，问一个女人她想要这份工作多少。

More often, though, the situation is ambiguous, and all the more insidious for it. These fuzzy interactions are destabilizing because you can't pinpoint exactly where the line was crossed, or prove later to an outside party that a line was crossed at all. Because it's hard to name the bad behavior, it's too often given a pass and allowed to prevail.

但更常见的是，情况是模糊的，因此更加阴险。这些模糊的互动是不稳定的，因为你无法准确确定界线在哪里被越过，或者后来向外部方证明界线确实被越过了。因为很难命名不良行为，所以它经常被放过并被允许盛行。

Here are some examples from students:

以下是一些学生的例子：

"My mentor was standing across the room, laughing with a bunch of guys in senior management, and it was very clear that he was talking about me in a sexual manner. But when he beckoned me over and told me he wanted to introduce me to some colleagues, I went over and politely shook their hands. And then I wanted to die."

"我的导师站在房间的另一边，与一群高级管理人员一起笑，很明显他在以性方式谈论我。但当 beckoned 我过去并告诉我他想把我介绍给一些同事时，我走过去礼貌地握了他们的手。然后我想死。"

"My pastor asked me a lot of extremely specific questions about my sexual experiences with my boyfriend during a counseling session. Even though he didn't technically say or do anything inappropriate, I felt like I was going to throw up the whole time."

"我的牧师在咨询会议期间问了我很多关于我与男友性经历的极其具体的问题。尽管他在技术上没有说或做任何不合适的事情，但我感觉我整个时间都要吐了。"

"We met to talk about how much he loves my work and the possibility of a show at his gallery, but as soon as the drinks arrived, the questions got more and more personal, and I couldn't steer him back to talking about art. I never figured out what was going on: Was he saying that if I had sex with him, he'd give me a show?"

"我们见面谈论他有多喜欢我的作品以及在他的画廊举办展览的可能性，但饮料一上桌，问题就变得越来越个人化，我无法引导他回到谈论艺术。我从未弄清楚发生了什么：他是在说如果我和他发生性关系，他会给我一个展览吗？"

When you're frozen, you can't clearly determine the difference between an awkward, clumsy communication and genuine harassment. People who want to abuse their power often deliberately exploit that confusion; they keep it cloudy so that they can maintain plausible deniability—"Hey, now! I was just asking an innocent question."

当你被冻结时，你无法清楚地区分尴尬、笨拙的沟通和真正的骚扰。想要滥用权力的人经常故意利用这种困惑；他们让它变得模糊，这样他们就可以保持合理的否认——"嘿，现在！我只是在问一个无辜的问题。"

While you're stuck to the spot, trying to determine whether a question was innocent or ill-intentioned, abusers slide right in.

当你被困在原地，试图确定一个问题是无辜的还是恶意的时，施虐者会直接滑进来。

This type of ambiguous communication creates ideal conditions for the Freeze because it floods us with questions of our own, turning our attention in: "Wait, did he just say that? Did he mean what I think he meant? What happens if I'm overreacting and he didn't mean that at all?" All of this makes it very hard for us to get off the spot.

这种模糊的沟通为冻结创造了理想的条件，因为它让我们充满了自己的问题，把我们的注意力转向内："等等，他刚才说了那个吗？他的意思是我认为的那个意思吗？如果我反应过度而他的意思根本不是那样会怎样？"所有这些都使我们很难摆脱困境。

Break the Freeze, and you reclaim not only your voice, but the ability to cut through the fog of these murky scenarios.

打破冻结，你不仅重新获得你的声音，还有穿透这些模糊场景迷雾的能力。

Sometimes ambiguous communication is just clumsy. Maybe your new boss asked if you had a boyfriend because he doesn't have the social skills to come up with a question that wouldn't offend you. He asked if you have kids because he's been up every night for three months with a crying newborn and is desperate to commiserate. He asked if you like getting underwear for Valentine's Day because he's confused about what to get his new girlfriend, and you're a woman he feels comfortable talking to. He does need to learn that these questions are inappropriate in the workplace. But you won't have enough information to correct him properly until you've figured out if he's a genuine scumbag or just a dummy.

有时模糊的沟通只是笨拙的。也许你的新老板问你是否有一个男朋友，因为他没有社交技巧来提出一个不会冒犯你的问题。他问你是否有关孩子，因为他三个月来每天晚上都被一个哭泣的新生儿吵醒，迫切希望有人同情。他问你是否喜欢在情人节收到内衣，因为他对他应该给他的新女友什么感到困惑，而你是他觉得舒适交谈的女人。他确实需要知道这些问题在工作场所是不合适的。但直到你弄清楚他是一个真正的败类还是一个傻瓜之前，你不会有足够的信息来正确地纠正他。

Often, as we well know, this ambiguity isn't clumsiness at all. Predators say things like "It'd be a shame to lose a friend like me so early in your career, don't you think? You're going to need to prove to me that you really want this opportunity." Leaving you to wonder, "Well, what the hell does that mean?"

通常，正如我们所知，这种模糊根本不是笨拙。捕食者会说这样的话："在职业生涯这么早的时候就失去像我这样的朋友会很遗憾，你不觉得吗？你需要向我证明你真的想要这个机会。"让你想知道，"嗯，这到底是什么意思？"

It's not accidental that it's hard to tell exactly what is expected of you in these scenarios. These indirect, ambiguous statements cue the Good Girl to fall in line, and the predator is sensing and testing to find out if she has. If you freeze, he'll press forward, which is how so many of us have ended up in situations we did not want to be in, later blaming ourselves for not saying no quickly or loudly or emphatically enough. And if your response is negative, a predator can always use the gray area to walk it back: "Whoa, whoa, slow your horses! Nobody said anything about sex!"

很难准确说出在这些场景中对你期望什么是偶然的。这些间接的、模糊的陈述暗示好女孩要顺从，捕食者正在感知和测试以找出她是否已经顺从了。如果你冻结了，他会向前推进，这就是我们这么多人最终陷入我们不想陷入的情况，后来责备自己没有足够快、大声或强调地说不。如果你的反应是负面的，捕食者总是可以利用灰色地带把它收回："哇，哇，慢下来！没有人说过任何关于性的事情！"

Indeed, the bad guys often use these denials as a way to compound a woman's confusion and humiliation: "I've got a very nice wife at home. I don't have to get my rocks off with a silly little girl who thinks every guy who tries to be nice to her is the Big Bad Wolf." Or "Look, kid, you're cute, but you're not that cute, okay?"

 indeed，坏家伙经常使用这些否认作为增加女性困惑和羞辱的方式："我家里有一个很好的妻子。我不必和一个愚蠢的小女孩搞，她认为每个试图对她好的男人都是大坏狼。"或者"看，孩子，你很可爱，但你没有那么可爱，好吗？"

Of course, given what we now know about power dynamics, it's clear why this tactic is so effective—comments like these, surgical strikes designed to shame and humiliate, push a woman deeper into the Freeze by putting even more attention on her: they skewer her in place.

当然，鉴于我们现在对权力动态的了解，很明显为什么这种策略如此有效——像这样的评论，旨在羞辱和羞辱的外科打击，通过将更多注意力放在她身上，将女性推入更深的冻结：他们把她钉在原地。

We cut through this ambiguity using location, the very same tool you'll use to navigate someone else's resistance.

我们使用定位来穿透这种模糊，这是你将用来应对他人抵抗的相同工具。

When dealing with ambiguity, the first step is to verbally identify the situation as you perceive it. This is a really simple sentence: "It seems like ___________." The second step is to immediately ask for verification from the other person. "Is that true?"

在处理模糊时，第一步是用语言识别你感知到的情况。这是一个非常简单的句子："似乎___________。"第二步是立即向对方寻求验证。"那是真的吗？"

"It seems like you're not entirely comfortable with the idea of a woman wearing a headscarf in a front-facing role; is that true?"

"似乎你对女性在面向客户的角色中戴头巾的想法并不完全舒服；那是真的吗？"

"It seems like you're more interested in a romantic or sexual relationship with me than you are in a friendship. Is that true?"

"似乎你对与我的浪漫或性关系比友谊更感兴趣。那是真的吗？"

"It seems like you're saying that I need to prove to you that I really want this promotion by sleeping with you. Is that true?"

"似乎你在说我需要通过和你上床来向你证明我真的想要这个晋升。那是真的吗？"

Whether they verify or deny, you now have them in a spot you can work with. Maybe you misconstrued his intention, but now you've both agreed on what's appropriate and what isn't. And if the guy uses the ambiguity to backtrack when you know damn well he was being predatory, use your next communication to lock in his denial. "Oh! I'm so relieved this isn't that kind of a workplace, and that my promotion will be dependent exclusively on my performance!" Then both of you know that you have his number.

无论他们验证还是否认，你现在都把他们放在一个你可以处理的地方。也许你误解了他的意图，但现在你们俩都同意什么是合适的，什么是不合适的。如果这个男人利用模糊来反悔，而你非常清楚他当时是捕食性的，用你的下一次沟通来锁定他的否认。"哦！我很放心这不是那种工作场所，我的晋升将完全取决于我的表现！"然后你们俩都知道你掌握了他的底细。

This tool is useful in a variety of situations—not just to determine who's a predator and who isn't. For instance, I particularly like to use location as a way to defuse backhanded compliments—the kind of double-edged flattery that contains both praise and insult. Because these contain two contradictory messages, they will likely require two location statements.

这个工具在各种情况下都很有用——不仅仅是确定谁是捕食者，谁不是。例如，我特别喜欢使用定位作为化解反手恭维的方式——那种包含赞扬和侮辱的双刃奉承。因为这些包含两个矛盾的信息，它们可能需要两个定位声明。

Your sister-in-law says: "I'm really happy that you're starting to dress in a way that's flattering to your body."

你的嫂子说："我真的很高兴你开始以对你的身体讨好的方式穿着。"

You need to locate both messages, and ask for verification: "It seems that you admire my suit. It also seems like you have some judgments about other outfits I've worn. Is that true?"

你需要定位两个信息，并寻求验证："似乎你欣赏我的套装。似乎你对我穿过的其他服装有一些判断。那是真的吗？"

You follow the response with a question that Turns the Spotlight back onto the asker, calibrated according to context and what you'd like to happen next.

你用一个问题跟随回应，这个问题把聚光灯转回提问者身上，根据上下文和你希望接下来发生的事情进行校准。

"Are you trying to be hurtful?"

"你是想伤害人吗？"

"Are you familiar with the concept of the backhanded compliment?"

"你熟悉反手恭维的概念吗？"

"How do you think it feels to be on the receiving end of a backhanded compliment like that one?"

"你认为收到像那样的反手恭维是什么感觉？"

"Is it customary for you to play fashion critic for the women you know?"

"对你来说，为你认识的女性扮演时尚评论家是习惯性的吗？"

Let's look at another one.

让我们看另一个。

"Usually girls who wear as much makeup as you do aren't smart enough for me, but I would actually date you."

"通常像我一样化这么多妆的女孩对我来说不够聪明，但我实际上会和你约会。"

Locate and verify: "It seems like you find me intelligent. It also seems like you have a lot of judgment about women who wear a lot of makeup. Is that true?"

定位并验证："似乎你觉得我很聪明。似乎你对化很多妆的女性有很多判断。那是真的吗？"

"Yeah, I mean, girls that look like you aren't usually very bright."

"是的，我的意思是，看起来像你这样的女孩通常不太聪明。"

Location again: "It seems like you're saying I'm both super-attractive and smart—and that somehow shocks you. Is that true?"

再次定位："似乎你在说我既超级有吸引力又聪明——这让你感到震惊。那是真的吗？"

"I usually find it's one or the other."

"我通常发现它是一个或另一个。"

Turning the Spotlight: "You have a lot to learn about women, don't you?"

转向聚光灯："你对女性有很多要学的，不是吗？"

Depending on how much fun you're having, you can keep going, or opt for a harder slap: "Do you know how incredibly obnoxious that question made you seem?"

 depending on你玩得有多开心，你可以继续，或者选择一个更严厉的打击："你知道那个问题让你看起来多么令人难以置信的讨厌吗？"

It's very important to be able to have fun with ambiguous communications in this way, especially in low-risk, low-stakes situations. If we don't have the skills to clarify them, these ambiguous statements end up providing us with "evidence" of our own suspicions, without any interrogation of whether these are actually true.

能够以这种方式玩转模糊的沟通是非常重要的，特别是在低风险、低风险的情况下。如果我们没有澄清它们的技能，这些模糊的陈述最终会为我们提供我们自己怀疑的"证据"，而不需要任何询问这些是否实际上是真实的。

"Of course he's accusing me of being too emotional; men always use that as an excuse not to take a woman seriously," you think darkly—when in fact, your friend was just clumsily trying to make sure that your feelings were taken into account.

"当然，他在指责我太情绪化；男人总是用这个作为不认真对待女人的借口，"你阴沉地想——事实上，你的朋友只是笨拙地试图确保你的感受被考虑在内。

This tool, then, not only helps us to clarify communications with others, but also helps us to sense and test our own held beliefs.

那么这个工具不仅帮助我们澄清与他人的沟通，还帮助我们感知和测试我们自己持有的信念。

### Testing Our Own Beliefs | 测试我们自己的信念

Every terrace on the building across from mine has its own wooden owl. These owls don't move, or make frightening sounds, or smell like predators, and yet the neighborhood pigeons stay away; the mere shape of an owl is enough to convince the pigeons that there's danger.

我对面建筑物的每个露台都有自己的木制猫头鹰。这些猫头鹰不移动，不发出可怕的声音，也不闻起来像捕食者，然而附近的鸽子却避开；仅仅猫头鹰的形状就足以让鸽子相信有危险。

This is a shortcut in the pigeon brain, and a worthwhile one, because their very survival may depend on it. But we're not pigeons. And it presents the question: How many of our own fears—that she'll be mad, that he'll never agree, that they'll say no—are really just wooden owls?

这是鸽子大脑中的一个捷径，而且是一个值得的捷径，因为它们的生存可能依赖于它。但我们不是鸽子。它提出了一个问题：我们自己的恐惧——她会生气，他永远不会同意，他们会说不——有多少真的只是木制猫头鹰？

As I went through my twenties, I watched my female friends analyze the text messages they received from colleagues, bosses, family members, and potential love interests. My friends would create intricate stories around those texts—they were being insulted or ghosted or disrespected or shut down—based, as far as I could tell, on nothing but their own superstitions and assumptions.

当我二十多岁时，我看着我的女性朋友分析她们从同事、老板、家人和潜在恋爱对象那里收到的短信。我的朋友们会围绕这些短信创造复杂的故事——他们被侮辱或被幽灵或被不尊重或被关闭——据我所知，完全基于他们自己的迷信和假设。

"But how do you know he's seeing someone else?" I'd ask, frustrated. "Have you asked him if he's breaking up with you?" or "Shouldn't you find out if your boss really meant that he'd never promote you, before you quit your dream job?"

"但你怎么知道他在和别人约会？"我会问，很沮丧。"你问过他是否要和你分手吗？"或者"在你辞掉梦想工作之前，你不应该弄清楚你的老板是否真的意味着他永远不会提拔你吗？"

The world becomes very small when you never check your assumptions for talons. I see this all the time now, when I'm counseling people in relationships. "Oh, I can't ask for monogamy," Brooke tells me—because of an offhand comment her guy made one time after a movie. "He doesn't like vacations; he never has," Kryssie explains about her husband of thirty years. But people grow, and their desires change all the time; how can a relationship possibly thrive when it's constrained by a thirty-year-old fixed belief?

当你从不检查你的假设是否有爪子时，世界变得非常小。我现在经常看到这一点，当我在咨询关系中的人时。"哦，我不能要求一夫一妻制，"布鲁克告诉我——因为她的男人在电影后一次随口说的话。"他不喜欢度假；他从来没有，"克丽丝在谈到她三十年的丈夫时解释说。但人们会成长，他们的欲望一直在变化；当关系受到三十年前固定信念的约束时，它怎么可能蓬勃发展？

Are your owls real—or make-believe?

你的猫头鹰是真的——还是假装的？

Many times, we can determine whether something is an owl or a decoy with a simple question: "Hey—are you breaking up with me?" But if we never check, then the baby goes out with the bathwater. We end up throwing out a whole category—most men, at most times—because they vaguely resemble owls.

很多时候，我们可以用一个简单的问题来确定某物是猫头鹰还是诱饵："嘿——你要和我分手吗？"但如果我们从不检查，那么婴儿就会和洗澡水一起倒掉。我们最终会扔掉整个类别——大多数男人，在大多数时候——因为它们隐约像猫头鹰。

Because we're not pigeons, we can walk right up to that shape and give it a knock, especially now that you have some amazing tools, like Asking, and the location tool to help you assess what's really going on.

因为我们不是鸽子，我们可以直接走到那个形状前给它敲一敲，特别是现在你有一些神奇的工具，比如要求，和定位工具来帮助你评估真正发生了什么。

A clumsy text from a new suitor might read as a "red flag." Show it to your girlfriends, and they'll confirm: "Don't go there." If you don't test it, though, all you end up with is an accumulation of evidence that the world is full of stupid, unworthy, hopeless men. You never get the chance to see who they truly are, or to use your influence with them to create an ally. The prison walls around you are made of your own assumptions.

来自新追求者的笨拙短信可能读起来像"红旗"。把它给你的女朋友看，她们会确认："不要去那里。"但如果你不测试它，你最终只会积累证据，证明世界充满了愚蠢、不值得、绝望的男人。你永远没有机会看到他们真正的样子，或者利用你对他们的影响力来创造盟友。你周围的监狱墙是由你自己的假设构成的。

When you reflexively avoid all potential friction—especially without verifying what you suspect to be true!—you also avoid discovery. Every time you walk the line back on what you are willing to investigate, your world gets a little smaller. But there's no cocoon small enough to keep you safe; even if you never leave your house, the world will still find a way to hurt your feelings and step on your toes.

当你反射性地避免所有潜在的摩擦——特别是在不验证你怀疑是真实的情况下！——你也避免发现。每次你把你愿意调查的界限向后推，你的世界就会变得更小一点。但没有足够小的茧来保护你；即使你永远不离开家，世界仍然会找到伤害你的感情和踩你脚趾的方式。

The only way to truly feel safe—and, ultimately, powerful—is to venture out, confident that you have the ability to accurately determine what's going on, and knowing that you'll be able to handle what happens next.

真正感到安全——并最终强大——的唯一方法是冒险出去，自信你有能力准确确定正在发生的事情，并知道你将能够处理接下来发生的事情。
