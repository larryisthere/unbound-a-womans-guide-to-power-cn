# Chapter 10: THE LOVE BEHIND THE STOP SIGN | 第十章：停止标志背后的爱

## The Power of Playing with "No" | 与"不"字游戏的力量

Imagine all of the amazing ideas in this world that never came to be, all of the really important requests that were never formulated, the secret longings never shared, the intimate connections never made—simply because the person who wanted to propose them was afraid of hearing the word "no."

想象世界上所有从未实现的惊人想法，所有从未表达的重要请求，从未分享的秘密渴望，从未建立的亲密连接——仅仅因为想要提出它们的人害怕听到"不"这个词。

Too many women never hear no because they never put themselves in a position to hear it—they don't ask. Which also means they don't hear yes as often as they should, either.

太多女性从未听到"不"，因为她们从未让自己处于可能听到它的位置——她们不问。这也意味着她们也不像应该的那样经常听到"是"。

The waste is colossal.

浪费是巨大的。

You know how to dig deep into your desires and how to alchemize your emotions. You understand how to use power dynamics to break the compression of Good Girl conditioning, and you see what a powerful tool Asking can be in creating new roles for the people in your life. But even with all of these skills and mastery over your attention and passion and freedom and power—guess what? You're still going to occasionally encounter the word "no."

你知道如何深入挖掘你的欲望，以及如何炼金你的情绪。你理解如何使用权力动态来打破好女孩条件反射的压迫，你看到要求（Asking）在为你生活中的人创造新角色方面是多么强大的工具。但即使掌握了所有这些技能和对注意力、激情、自由和权力的掌握——猜猜看？你仍然会偶尔遇到"不"这个词。

Are we going to let that stop us? Hell, no.

我们会让那阻止我们吗？绝对不。

If and when a no does come, you cannot let it be the last and final word. You can respect the no, but still stay connected and engaged—it can be the beginning of a conversation, not the end of one.

如果当"不"真的来了，你不能让它成为最后和最终的话。你可以尊重"不"，但仍然保持连接和参与——它可以是对话的开始，而不是结束。

We must be able to hear no—and keep going.

我们必须能够听到"不"——并继续前进。

It's time to immunize you against no.

是时候让你对"不"免疫了。

### Redefining Conflict | 重新定义冲突

Women aren't trained to deal with conflict; this lack of skill leaves us avoiding it. Good Girl conditioning teaches us to smooth and accommodate, not to advocate for ourselves, especially in the face of someone else's resistance.

女性没有接受过处理冲突的训练；这种技能的缺乏使我们避免它。好女孩条件反射教我们平滑和适应，而不是为自己辩护，特别是在面对他人的抵抗时。

And yet all of us will encounter some form of conflict every day—in our interactions with doctors and lawyers and airport gate agents, in our sexual and romantic relationships, in our creative partnerships, in our workplaces, and in our families of origin and choice. So we operate at a tremendous disadvantage if, instead of becoming skilled at moving someone through their resistance, we avoid it instead.

然而，我们所有人每天都会遇到某种形式的冲突——在与医生、律师和机场登机口代理人的互动中，在我们的性和浪漫关系中，在我们的创意合作中，在我们的工作场所中，在我们的原生家庭和选择的家庭中。所以如果我们避免它，而不是变得擅长帮助某人通过他们的抵抗，我们就会处于巨大的劣势。

People don't say no (most of the time) to fuck with you; they do it to protect something that matters to them. Just as you have a right to say no, so do they. And just as you might say no to protect something you care about, so do they.

人们说"不"（大多数时候）不是为了搞你；他们这样做是为了保护对他们重要的东西。就像你有权说"不"一样，他们也有。就像你可能会说"不"来保护你在乎的东西一样，他们也会这样做。

This is resistance. And being able to hear no is the very first step in being able to navigate someone else's resistance.

这就是抵抗。能够听到"不"是能够驾驭他人抵抗的第一步。

Culturally, we have two ways of working with resistance: we either crush it or avoid it. Neither method forces us to truly engage with it; not surprisingly, neither works particularly well. Say you commit to working on a novel and promise yourself that you'll write four pages every morning—except that one day your four pages just won't come.

在文化上，我们有两种处理抵抗的方式：我们要么粉碎它，要么避免它。这两种方法都不强迫我们真正参与其中；毫不奇怪，两者都不特别有效。假设你承诺写一本小说，并承诺自己每天早上写四页——除了有一天你的四页就是写不出来。

You've encountered resistance.

你遇到了抵抗。

Maybe you grit your teeth and grind the pages out anyway, crushing the resistance in your path. If you do that long enough, you'll end up with a manuscript, but in the process, you'll have pounded all the tender, joyful life out of the writing, and you'll end up with a dry, soulless piece of work. On the other hand, if you avoid your resistance entirely and drift away from your desk, then you'll never move forward.

也许你咬紧牙关，无论如何都要把页面磨出来，粉碎你路上的抵抗。如果你这样做足够长时间，你最终会得到一份手稿，但在这个过程中，你会把写作中所有温柔、快乐的生命都敲打出来，最终会得到一份干燥、没有灵魂的作品。另一方面，如果你完全避免你的抵抗并漂离你的桌子，那么你将永远不会前进。

We do the same thing when we encounter resistance in others. Either we drop the subject entirely, letting a completely valid concern or desire or important conversation fall by the wayside, or we proceed without their consent, ramming our desires down their throats.

当我们在他人身上遇到抵抗时，我们做同样的事情。我们要么完全放弃这个话题，让完全有效的关切或欲望或重要对话落在路边，要么在没有他们同意的情况下继续，把我们的欲望塞进他们的喉咙。

Force someone to comply with your orders using threats and intimidation and fear, and before long you'll find yourself powering the whole ship because you've completely shut them down. This isn't the kind of leadership the world needs, nor is it actually powerful in the sense that it doesn't use all the energy available, it doesn't use all the love available, it doesn't use all the ingenuity available.

使用威胁、恐吓和恐惧强迫某人遵守你的命令，不久你就会发现自己要为整艘船提供动力，因为你已经完全关闭了他们。这不是世界需要的那种领导力，也不是真正强大的，因为它不使用所有可用的能量，不使用所有可用的爱，不使用所有可用的独创性。

And when you steamroll another person, you aren't able to hear what might be vital information that the person is carrying about the project or the relationship. They may be saying it in a clumsy and inappropriate way, or the information may not be valuable at all, but you'll never be able to make that determination if you flatten them.

当你碾压另一个人时，你无法听到那个人可能携带的关于项目或关系的重要信息。他们可能以笨拙和不恰当的方式说出来，或者信息可能根本没有价值，但如果你压扁他们，你将永远无法做出这种判断。

Avoiding resistance doesn't work either. One way to avoid resistance is never, ever to ask for anything that might receive a no. In one way, it's true: if you stick to utterly safe requests, you will not have to deal with much conflict in the moment. But where is the potential for growth and transformation if every single thing you ask for is one you're 100 percent sure will be met with a yes? And ultimately, you'll find that you've won the battle and lost the war because, as we've seen, all these "things unsaid" fester to become a highly destructive force, a major driver of disharmony and disconnection.

避免抵抗也不起作用。避免抵抗的一种方法是永远不要问任何可能收到"不"的东西。在某种程度上，这是真的：如果你坚持完全安全的请求，你就不必在当下处理太多冲突。但如果你要求的每一件事都是你100%确定会得到"是"的，那么成长和转变的潜力在哪里？最终，你会发现你赢了战斗但输了战争，因为正如我们所看到的，所有这些"未曾言说之事"溃烂成为高度破坏性的力量，是不和谐和脱节的主要驱动因素。

If a resistance-avoider accidentally ventures into difficult territory, she tends to swerve or back away. Often, this is a gesture made out of love. Many of us are afraid of causing pain or embarrassment or discomfort in another person by voicing something that has gone unspoken for too long: "Fourteen years in, and now I'm going to tell him I don't like the way he eats my pussy?"

如果一个抵抗避免者意外地进入困难领域，她倾向于转向或后退。通常，这是出于爱的手势。我们中的许多人害怕通过说出已经沉默太久的事情而在另一个人身上造成痛苦或尴尬或不适："十四年了，现在我要告诉他我不喜欢他吃我阴部的方式？"

Or maybe she asked for something she wanted and got it, only to find that it didn't satisfy her underlying desire, so now she's decided that (instead of refining the Ask), her only option is to go without. "I just don't want to get into it with him again," students tell me, about partners or coworkers. "It's not so bad. I can deal with it the way it is." Or, Independent Woman–style: "It's easier just to do it myself."

或者也许她要求她想要的东西并得到了它，却发现它不能满足她潜在的欲望，所以现在她决定（而不是完善要求），她唯一的选择就是没有它。"我只是不想再和他一起做这件事了，"学生们告诉我，关于伴侣或同事。"没那么糟。我可以这样处理它。"或者，独立女性风格："我自己做更容易。"

But if you can't meet the people in your life with your truth because you're avoiding everything that might hurt them, then you are not protecting them; you are hiding and lying. If you can't express where you are at because you are cringing from conflict, then there's no you for the other person to respond to. This isn't intimacy, but the kind of fake peace that leads to stagnation and an insidious conformity.

但如果你不能以你的真相面对你生活中的人，因为你在避免一切可能伤害他们的事情，那么你不是在保护他们；你是在隐藏和撒谎。如果你不能表达你的位置，因为你在逃避冲突，那么就没有你可以让另一个人回应。这不是亲密，而是导致停滞和阴险顺从的虚假和平。

It certainly isn't power.

这当然不是权力。

And this is especially true because resistance is often a site for real transformation. I'm not just interested in redefining power in this book; I want to redefine conflict:

这一点尤其正确，因为抵抗往往是真正转变的场所。我不仅仅对在这本书中重新定义权力感兴趣；我想重新定义冲突：

Healthy conflict is where two worlds meet.

健康的冲突是两个世界相遇的地方。

Conflict creates tension, yes, but also intimacy and invention. Friction, let's not forget, is how babies are made. This is why I get so excited when I meet opposition. In my opinion, it's not something to be feared, but something to be welcomed—in many cases, nothing less than a doorway to shared intimacy.

冲突创造紧张，是的，但也创造亲密和发明。摩擦，让我们不要忘记，是婴儿如何被制造的。这就是为什么当我遇到反对时如此兴奋。在我看来，这不是应该害怕的东西，而是应该欢迎的东西——在很多情况下，它正是通向共同亲密的门。

Learn to engage with another person's resistance, and not only do you get what you need, but you do so by collaborating with the skills, fears, concerns, and desires of the other person. That is power; that is synergy—a way of being that is generative, not destructive. To work this way does not waste anything—including the other person's own resources through violence or suppression.

学会参与另一个人的抵抗，你不仅得到你需要的东西，而且通过与另一个人的技能、恐惧、关切和欲望合作来做到这一点。这就是权力；这就是协同作用——一种生成性的而非破坏性的存在方式。以这种方式工作不会浪费任何东西——包括另一个人通过暴力或压制自己的资源。

I want you to be so deft at managing resistance that you'll begin to court those nos. You're going to invite them, get excited for them, and delight in them when they come because you'll know that, handled with curiosity and sensitivity, they're often the first step toward the kind of imaginative collaboration that makes relationships sing.

我希望你如此熟练地管理抵抗，以至于你会开始追求那些"不"。你会邀请它们，为它们感到兴奋，当它们来临时你会感到高兴，因为你会知道，带着好奇心和敏感性处理，它们往往是朝着那种让关系歌唱的富有想象力的合作的第一步。

You won't bulldoze past the other person's no like a dictator, or run for cover because you can't manage the conflict. You won't force the other person to explain or defend their no, but to reveal their concerns. Sometimes what's behind their no will be simple, easily dealt with. Other times, it will be unexpected—a gateway to an even bigger desire, a previously unimagined opportunity to collaborate on a project even greater than the one you were initially proposing.

你不会像独裁者一样碾压另一个人的"不"，也不会因为无法管理冲突而逃跑。你不会强迫另一个人解释或辩护他们的"不"，而是揭示他们的关切。有时他们"不"背后的东西会很简单，很容易处理。其他时候，它将是意想不到的——通向更大欲望的门户，一个以前无法想象的机会，在比你最初提出的更大的项目上合作。

We'll find the space inside the resistance, which is where the magic happens.

我们会在抵抗中找到空间，这就是魔法发生的地方。

When we stay curious—when we stay in the uncomfortable place—we reach the thing they really care about.

当我们保持好奇——当我们留在不舒服的地方——我们到达他们真正关心的事情。

But first, we have to get used to hearing no.

但首先，我们必须习惯听到"不"。

### The Leash of Attention | 注意力的缰绳

Here, as always, our success will depend on the quality and the direction of our attention.

在这里，一如既往，我们的成功将取决于我们注意力的质量和方向。

One of the very first things that happens to many women when they encounter any form of resistance—whether that's a straight-up no or a less direct form of it—is that our attention snaps back onto ourselves.

当许多女性遇到任何形式的抵抗时——无论是直接的"不"还是不那么直接的形式——最先发生的事情之一是我们的注意力突然回到我们自己身上。

We hear no, or sense conflict brewing, and it drives us inside: "Ugh; I knew I shouldn't have asked," or "He would have agreed if I'd phrased that differently," or "I should have taken another look at the data before opening my mouth."

我们听到"不"，或感觉到冲突正在酝酿，它把我们推向内心："呃；我知道我不应该问，"或"如果我以不同的方式表达，他会同意的，"或"在我开口之前我应该再看一遍数据。"

Then either we stay in that sub state and run away or the rubber band snaps back the other way as we try to force ourselves into a dominant state while our attention is still on ourselves. Which usually means that the next thing that comes out of our mouths is going to be incongruent—it's going to sound to the other person like an attack. Cue a finger-wagging reprimand, delivered with both an apologetic Good Girl head tilt and the furious laser eyes of death, a tense, tight smile, and a tone of voice that makes it clear she's sacrificing herself—again—for you, all stated in the form of a question.

然后我们要么停留在那种顺从状态并逃跑，要么橡皮筋向另一个方向弹回，我们试图强迫自己进入主导状态，而我们的注意力仍然在我们自己身上。这通常意味着从我们嘴里说出的下一件事将是不一致的——对另一个人来说听起来像是攻击。手指挥舞的谴责，伴随着道歉的好女孩头倾斜和愤怒的死亡激光眼，紧张、紧绷的微笑，以及明确表示她正在为自己牺牲——再次——为你，所有都以问题的形式陈述。

But the real casualty of this snapback into sub state is energetic: the other person feels like they've been dropped. You were holding them in your attention—and now you've disappeared into yourself! Whatever sense of safety you might have created is gone, whisked away with your attention. And what he takes away from the encounter is the understanding that he can't say any kind of no to you without hurting you beyond repair.

但这种弹回到顺从状态的真正受害者是能量：另一个人感觉他们被丢弃了。你把他们抱在你的注意力中——现在你消失在你自己里面！你可能创造的任何安全感都消失了，随着你的注意力被带走。他从这次遭遇中带走的是理解，他不能对你说任何形式的"不"而不伤害你到无法修复的程度。

When you resist the temptation to retreat into yourself and instead stay with the other person, no matter what they've said or what they're doing, then you create a situation where the other person feels safe—safer, even, than they did before the conflict arose.

当你抵抗撤退到自己里面的诱惑，而是与另一个人待在一起，无论他们说了什么或正在做什么，然后你创造了一个另一个人感到安全的情况——甚至比冲突出现之前更安全。

Do not drop the leash of attention. Keep your attention out.

不要放下注意力的缰绳。保持你的注意力在外。

Keeping your attention out after a no is an extremely powerful move. When someone begins to understand that they can share their whole truth with you, and that you can hear it without bursting into flames, even—especially!—if that truth is different from your own, then you are creating a situation where the other person can continue to reveal themselves. This is the beginning of a real conversation, a space where change happens.

在"不"之后保持你的注意力在外是一个极其强大的举动。当某人开始理解他们可以与你分享他们的全部真相，你可以听到它而不会爆发，甚至——特别是！——如果那个真相与你自己的不同，那么你正在创造一种情况，让另一个人可以继续揭示自己。这是真正对话的开始，一个改变发生的空间。

So stay there.

所以留在那里。

#### EXERCISE | 练习

##### Inoculating against No, Part One: The Rigged No | 对"不"免疫，第一部分：预设的"不"

You'll need a friend for this one. It's a good one to do in a group—many Mistress groups use it as a warm-up.

这个你需要一个朋友。这是一个在小组中做的好练习——许多女主人小组（Mistress groups）用它作为热身。

Partner with another Mistress. You are going to ask your partner for twenty objects and experiences, things you want and things you don't—a smoothie, a kiss, a castle, a promotion, an iguana, or for them to pay off your student loans.

与另一个女主人（Mistress）配对。你将向你的伙伴要求二十个物品和经历，你想要的和你不想要的——冰沙、一个吻、一座城堡、升职、一只鬣蜥，或者让他们还清你的学生贷款。

No matter what you ask for, they will say no.

无论你要求什么，他们都会说"不"。

See and feel what happens in your body when they say no. It's more than likely a contraction—even though your Ask is a fictional one, and may not even be something you want! Don't beat yourself up, simply note the response and, as quickly as you can, turn your attention back out onto the other person. When you're ready, ask the next question.

看到并感受当他们说"不"时你身体中发生的事情。这很可能是收缩——即使你的要求是虚构的，甚至可能不是你想要的！不要责备自己，只需记录响应，并尽可能快地将你的注意力转回到另一个人身上。当你准备好时，问下一个问题。

Any time you feel yourself recoil or freeze—celebrate it! The first part of the vaccine is working. As you go, note how it becomes easier to keep your unwavering attention out, on them. After twenty requests, switch roles, so that you're the one saying no.

任何时候你感到自己退缩或冻结——庆祝它！疫苗的第一部分正在工作。当你进行时，注意保持你不屈不挠的注意力在外，在他们身上变得更容易。二十个请求后，切换角色，这样你就是说"不"的那个人。

Be warned (and get excited!): This next exercise is meant to be ridiculous. It's meant to be hilarious, silly, outrageous—and everything in between. It's also the second phase of your vaccine against no.

警告（并感到兴奋！）：下一个练习旨在荒谬。它旨在有趣、愚蠢、离谱——以及两者之间的一切。这也是你对"不"免疫的第二阶段。

---

#### EXERCISE | 练习

##### Inoculating against No, Part Two: Begging for No | 对"不"免疫，第二部分：乞求"不"

Pair off into twos.

配对成两个人。

One of you will get on your knees and play a sub who begs "Please." The other will play a domme who says "No."

你们中的一个会跪下，扮演一个乞求"请"的被支配者（sub）。另一个会扮演说"不"的女支配者（domme）。

That's it! Set a timer for three minutes, then switch.

就是这样！设置一个三分钟的计时器，然后切换。

If the function of the Rigged No is to train you to keep your attention out when you hear it, then the goal of this one is to hear no a thousand different ways, and a thousand times. For the duration of this exercise, throw out everything you've learned about attention in or out—the focus here is to explore every desperate, funny, tyrannical, sexy, ridiculous way you can beg "Please" and your partner can say "No."

如果预设的"不"的功能是训练你在听到它时保持注意力在外，那么这个练习的目标是以一千种不同的方式听到"不"，并且一千次。在这个练习的持续期间，抛弃你学到的关于注意力在内或在外的一切——这里的重点是探索你可以乞求"请"和你的伙伴可以说"不"的每一种绝望、有趣、暴虐、性感、荒谬的方式。

Both domme and sub will get the chance to play many different characters. Have fun! If you're begging: Cajole. Tease. Holler. Ask like a sexy vixen. Ask like you're furious. Beg like you're desperate. Throw a bratty temper tantrum. Whine. Ask like you don't care.

女支配者（domme）和被支配者（sub）都有机会扮演许多不同的角色。玩得开心！如果你在乞求：哄骗。戏弄。大喊。像一个性感的泼妇一样问。像你愤怒一样问。像你绝望一样乞求。发脾气。抱怨。像你不在乎一样问。

If you're the domme saying no: try it cheerfully, and then like an ice queen, and then like the request is beneath your contempt. Try it like you're flirting, like you're delighted they asked, like someone woke you up from a nap, like your father says it, like you're saving their life.

如果你是说"不"的女支配者：愉快地尝试，然后像冰女王一样，然后像请求在你的鄙视之下。像你在调情一样尝试，像你很高兴他们问了，像有人把你从午睡中叫醒，像你父亲说的一样，像你在拯救他们的生命。

If you're horrified of sounding strident, go ahead and screech. If you tend to avoid conflict, explore how it feels to stomp and holler and demand. If you're a yeller in everyday life, try wheedling instead. Go there, in this safe space, so you can access the energy locked up in those forbidden roles.

如果你害怕听起来刺耳，尽管尖叫吧。如果你倾向于避免冲突，探索踩脚、大喊和要求的感觉。如果你在日常生活中是一个大喊大叫的人，试试哄骗。在这个安全的空间里，去那里，这样你就可以访问那些被禁止角色中锁定的能量。

You will inadvertently find ways of saying no that feel good to you—that's not the goal, but it will happen. The same thing is true about "please," but again, it's incidental. We beg for no so that we experience the surprising power of learning what it's like to hear that tiny, powerful word—and not just once, but fifty, sixty, eighty times in a row, and many, many different ways—irritated, loving, funny, deadpan, scorching.

你会无意中找到对你说"不"感觉很好的方式——这不是目标，但它会发生。关于"请"也是如此，但同样，这是偶然的。我们乞求"不"，这样我们就可以体验学习听到那个微小、强大的词是什么感觉的令人惊讶的力量——不仅仅是一次，而是连续五十、六十、八十次，以及许多、许多不同的方式——恼怒的、爱的、有趣的、面无表情的、灼热的。

Every one of them reinforces the message: hearing no won't kill you! A powerful takeaway, given that most women are so terrified of hearing that word that we never ask for anything where it might be a possible outcome.

它们中的每一个都强化了这个信息：听到"不"不会杀死你！一个强大的收获，考虑到大多数女性如此害怕听到这个词，以至于我们从不要求任何可能产生这种结果的东西。

This megadose knocks the power right out of it.

这个超大剂量把它里面的力量敲打出来。

How was that? Did you love the experience of getting to say no a thousand times—and realize how little you get to say it in real life? Did you find yourself eagerly looking forward to your partner's next no so that you could find a brand-new way to beg? Did you find yourself looking forward to your partner's next beg, just so you could get super-creative with your next despicable no?

怎么样？你喜欢说"不"一千次的经历——并意识到你在现实生活中说它的机会是多么少吗？你是否发现自己热切地期待着你伙伴的下一个"不"，这样你就可以找到一种全新的乞求方式？你是否发现自己期待着你伙伴的下一次乞求，只是为了你能在下一次可鄙的"不"上变得超级有创意？

If this exercise didn't make you laugh, then rinse and repeat—there's a reason I do it with private clients before their big negotiations and difficult conversations. It helps to break them out of the bracing against no that communicates a mixed message: what you want, and what you're afraid of at the same time. And it injects a spirit of carefree playfulness that's a hallmark of great domination.

如果这个练习没有让你笑，那就重复——我与私人客户在他们的大谈判和困难对话之前做它是有原因的。它有助于让他们摆脱为"不"做准备，这传达了混合信息：你想要的，以及你同时害怕的。它注入了一种无忧无虑的嬉戏精神，这是伟大支配的标志。

Begging for No is an exercise that underlines for me the importance of actually doing an exercise, as opposed to simply reading about it. In class, people tend to embark on this exercise feeling a little self-conscious and stagy. But after about thirty seconds, that falls away as students start to feel what's happening in their bodies—and to see what's happening in the bodies of their partners.

乞求"不"是一个对我来说强调实际做练习重要性的练习，而不是简单地阅读它。在课堂上，人们倾向于开始这个练习时感到有点自我意识和做作。但大约三十秒后，随着学生们开始感受他们身体中发生的事情——并看到他们伙伴身体中发生的事情，这种感觉就消失了。

I love to watch how the person saying no responds to different kinds of begs. And even though she knows it's impossible—even though there's no content whatsoever behind her "Please!"—the woman on her knees will really start trying to convince her partner with her beg. She'll start to stretch herself, experimenting with modes outside of her comfort zone. As one of my students joked to me after class, "I've never asked for anything in a sexy voice in my entire life—including sex." But she did while she was Begging for No—and was surprised to discover that it was the "please" that landed most successfully in the body of her partner.

我喜欢看说"不"的人如何回应不同类型的乞求。即使她知道这是不可能的——即使她的"请！"背后没有任何内容——跪着的女人真的会开始试图用她的乞求说服她的伙伴。她会开始伸展自己，尝试舒适区之外的模式。正如我的一个学生课后对我开玩笑说："我一生中从未以性感的声音要求过任何东西——包括性。"但她在乞求"不"时这样做了——并惊讶地发现，最成功落在她伙伴身体上的是"请"。

### Advanced Play: Congruence and Begging for No | 高级游戏：一致性和乞求"不"

When you've Begged for No a number of times, you may want to experiment with a more advanced version: one that explores congruence.

当你已经乞求"不"多次时，你可能想尝试一个更高级的版本：一个探索一致性的版本。

To do this, both the person using the dominant state of attention and the person using the submissive one will try to sincerely embody the impulse behind their please or their no, regardless of which state of attention they are occupying. Use whatever feeling is rising up in your body at that moment. Try to convince your partner with your please; when you're on the other side, really reject them with your no.

要做到这一点，使用主导注意力状态的人和使用顺从注意力状态的人都将尝试真诚地体现他们"请"或"不"背后的冲动，无论他们占据哪种注意力状态。使用那一刻在你身体中升起的任何感觉。尝试用你的"请"说服你的伙伴；当你在另一边时，真的用你的"不"拒绝他们。

Watch the other person's body to see how your communication lands. Did she soften, like she wanted to say yes to you—even though you weren't actually asking for anything at all? Was the sharpness of your no just enough to move her into the submissive state, or did she recoil a little, a sign that you'd gone too far and shut her down?

观察另一个人的身体，看看你的沟通如何着陆。她是否软化了，就像她想对你说"是"——即使你实际上根本没有要求任何东西？你的"不"的尖锐是否足以让她进入顺从状态，或者她是否稍微退缩，这是你走得太远并关闭她的标志？

In one class, I watched a woman commit to her begs with a fake, coy, sexy little-girl tone. It was a submissive-style Ask, even though her attention was turned out—there wasn't a congruent thing about it. There was nothing wrong with what she was doing; I'd given no instructions about congruence at all. But whether she knew it or not, her animal body was communicating with her partner domme's animal body—and the sub's disconnect meant that her domme was practically crawling out of her skin with irritation and disgust.

在一堂课中，我看着一个女人用虚假、害羞、性感的小女孩语气致力于她的乞求。这是一个顺从风格的要求，即使她的注意力向外——但关于它没有一致的事情。她做的没有什么不对；我根本没有给出关于一致性的指示。但无论她是否知道，她的动物身体正在与她伙伴女支配者的动物身体交流——被支配者的断开意味着她的女支配者几乎因为恼怒和厌恶而爬出她的皮肤。

As the woman using the dominant state of attention concentrated on getting her own attention back out again, the nos she delivered went from irritated and self-aware to providing the safety her (very incongruent) sub needed in order to feel good about begging. The domme was skilled enough to realize what was happening: had she remained turned inward and focused on her own discomfort, she would not have picked up on her sub's need for safety, and her sub would have stayed disconnected. In fact, her incongruence would likely have escalated.

当使用主导注意力状态的女人专注于再次把她的注意力转回来时，她发出的"不"从恼怒和自我意识到提供了她（非常不一致的）被支配者需要的安全，以便在乞求时感觉良好。女支配者足够熟练地意识到正在发生什么：如果她保持向内转并专注于她自己的不适，她不会注意到她被支配者对安全的需求，她的被支配者会保持断开。事实上，她的一致性可能会升级。

But because the domme was able to turn her attention out, the sub moved into a more submissive space, and saw the body and face of her domme change when she tried a more aligned approach.

但因为女支配者能够把她的注意力转出来，被支配者移动到一个更顺从的空间，并看到当她尝试更对齐的方法时，她女支配者的身体和脸发生变化。

It was a beautiful thing to see.

这是一个美丽的事情。

Another person's no must be respected, but it cannot be a stop sign without exploring what's behind it first. Not only because that means powerlessness for you, but because it means you lose an important opportunity to engage with another person about what they care about, what they value, what matters to them—the desire, the potential, the love behind the no.

另一个人的"不"必须受到尊重，但它不能是一个停止标志，而不首先探索它背后的东西。不仅因为那意味着你的无力，而且因为它意味着你失去了与另一个人就他们关心什么、他们重视什么、对他们重要什么——欲望、潜力、"不"背后的爱——进行交流的重要机会。
