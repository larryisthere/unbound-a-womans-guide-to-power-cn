# Chapter 06: EMOTIONAL ALCHEMY | 第六章：情感炼金术

## The Power of Rage | 愤怒的力量

Oh, I'm not angry," women tell me. "That's not really resonating with me; I'm not a very angry person."

"哦，我不生气，"女性告诉我。"这并没有真正引起我的共鸣；我不是一个很生气的人。"

Bullshit.

胡说。

And here's how I know for sure. In class, we do an exercise called "Things Unsaid," where students make a list of everything they've left unspoken. After we're done, students raise their hands and volunteer items from their list; these range from the trivial ("I've never told my boyfriend how much I detest mushrooms on pizza") to the positively devastating:

以下是我如何确定的。在课堂上，我们做一个叫做"未曾言说之事（Things Unsaid）"的练习，学生们列出所有她们没有说出来的事情。完成后，学生们举手自愿分享她们清单上的项目；从琐碎的（"我从未告诉我男朋友我有多讨厌披萨上的蘑菇"）到绝对毁灭性的：

"I didn't tell my mom my dad was cheating on her."

"我没有告诉我妈妈我爸爸在欺骗她。"

"I didn't say anything even though I knew my partner was lying in a multimillion-dollar negotiation."

"即使我知道我的合作伙伴在一个数百万美元的谈判中撒谎，我也什么也没说。"

"I never told my molester not to."

"我从未告诉过我的性侵犯者不要这样做。"

"I never told the medical board that my husband stole my prescription pad."

"我从未告诉医疗委员会我丈夫偷了我的处方笺。"

"I've never told anyone that I used to have sex for drugs."

"我从未告诉过任何人我过去用性换取毒品。"

"I never told my ex that 50/50 custody wasn't right for me, or for the kids."

"我从未告诉我的前夫，50/50的监护权对我或对孩子来说都不对。"

"I never told the coach training me for the Olympics that I hated to swim."

"我从未告诉训练我参加奥运会的教练我讨厌游泳。"

"I never told my daughter that she was conceived during a rape."

"我从未告诉我的女儿她是在一次强奸中受孕的。"

As the students speak, we feel a heaviness settle over the class. Sometimes, just to show everyone the universality of the experiences we're dealing with, I ask, "Who else feels guilty that they didn't expressly confront their abuser by telling him to stop?" Now, you can read all the statistics you want, but when nine women out of forty raise their hands, the reality of childhood sexual abuse hits you in the face like a bucket of ice water.

当学生们说话时，我们感到一种沉重感笼罩着课堂。有时，只是为了向每个人展示我们正在处理的经历的普遍性，我问："还有谁因为没有明确地通过告诉他们的施暴者停止来对抗他们而感到内疚？"现在，你可以阅读所有你想要的统计数据，但当四十个女人中有九个举起手时，童年性侵犯的现实就像一桶冰水一样打在脸上。

The fog in the room gets heavier, denser. Students yawn, slump over in their seats, prop their heads up, and shift around like they're ready for a nap.

房间里的雾气变得更重、更浓。学生们打哈欠，瘫坐在座位上，撑着头，四处移动，好像准备小睡一样。

So let me ask: Do you think the thick sleepiness that creeps over the room in the wake of those revelations is boredom? Or do you think, given the vast universe of female pain we've just summoned, that suppressed rage is a more likely culprit?

所以让我问：你认为在那些启示之后悄悄笼罩房间的浓厚睡意是无聊吗？或者你认为，考虑到我们刚刚召唤的女性痛苦的巨大宇宙，被压制的愤怒是更可能的罪魁祸首吗？

When anger doesn't have anywhere to go, it has an uncanny way of making us feel listless, exhausted, overwhelmed—numb. A lot of us live with that feeling all the time. Many students describe a low sex drive, a lack of direction, the feeling that they'll never figure out what their mission in this life is. At least one woman in every class I've ever taught has said something along the lines of "I'm tired of feeling like I'm looking out at the world from behind a pane of glass."

当愤怒无处可去时，它有一种奇怪的方式让我们感到无精打采、筋疲力尽、不知所措——麻木。我们很多人一直都有这种感觉。许多学生描述性欲低下、缺乏方向、感觉她们永远无法弄清楚她们在这生活中的使命是什么。我教过的每一堂课中，至少有一个女人说过类似这样的话："我厌倦了感觉像我从一块玻璃后面看着世界。"

That's powerlessness.

那就是无力感。

Good Girls are taught to suppress their fear, their shame, their rage. We chase compression! "I just need to hold it down, keep it together, get a grip, put on my game face, never let them see me cry," we tell ourselves and each other. We make ourselves tighter, harder, and more brittle as we white-knuckle our way through the world, gritting our teeth and gutting it out, sending ever more poisonous messages to the people around us underneath our ever more professional smiles.

好女孩被教导要压抑她们的恐惧、羞耻和愤怒。我们追求压迫！"我只需要按住它，保持在一起，抓住它，戴上我的游戏脸，永远不要让他们看到我哭，"我们告诉自己和其他人。当我们白指关节地穿过世界，咬紧牙关，坚持下去时，我们让自己变得更紧、更硬、更脆弱，在我们越来越专业的微笑下向我们周围的人发送越来越有毒的信息。

But it takes a tremendous amount of energy for us to suppress all these emotions—and furthermore means that we don't have access to any of the energy that's locked up there. Most important, the deep inner wisdom all those powerful emotions carry cannot be heard.

但压抑所有这些情绪需要巨大的能量——而且意味着我们无法获得锁在那里的任何能量。最重要的是，所有这些强烈情绪所携带的深层内在智慧无法被听到。

In the previous chapter, we talked about breaking the compression of the Smush by moving past Good Girl prohibitions against desire. In this one, we're going to explore what happens when you tap into the power behind the ugliest, nastiest emotion, the one a Good Girl can never admit to: rage.

在上一章中，我们讨论了通过超越好女孩对欲望的禁令来打破挤压的压迫。在这一章中，我们将探索当你挖掘最丑陋、最恶劣的情绪背后的力量时会发生什么，好女孩永远不能承认的情绪：愤怒。

### From Rage to Power | 从愤怒到权力

In talking about suppressed rage, I sometimes use the analogy of a leg that has fallen asleep.

在谈论被压制的愤怒时，我有时用一条睡着了的腿来比喻。

It's numb, and if you try to walk on it, you'll pitch right over. Let the blood flow a little so that it starts waking up, and it's scary; it hurts more than you think it will. But we learn to tolerate the horrible pins-and-needles stage, knowing that after we've given our leg a good shake, the pain will disappear entirely, leaving only mobility restored.

它是麻木的，如果你试图在上面行走，你会直接摔倒。让血液流动一点，这样它开始醒来，这很可怕；它比你想象的更痛。但我们学会忍受可怕的针刺阶段，知道在我们好好地摇动我们的腿之后，疼痛会完全消失，只留下恢复的活动能力。

The same thing is true about rage. When you first awaken it, it's painful, and you can't use it well, like the leg you can't walk on. But would you intentionally cut your circulation off again, putting your leg back to sleep? Of course not—and yet, that's precisely what Good Girls do with their rage.

愤怒也是如此。当你第一次唤醒它时，它是痛苦的，你不能很好地使用它，就像你不能在上面行走的腿。但你会故意再次切断你的循环，让你的腿重新入睡吗？当然不会——然而，这正是好女孩对她们的愤怒所做的。

We deny it, suppress it, lock it away in a little box. When it seeps out around the edges, we contort ourselves to disguise it. Occasionally, the top blows off, and then nobody's safe from the shrapnel, including ourselves.

我们否认它，压制它，把它锁在一个小盒子里。当它从边缘渗出时，我们扭曲自己来伪装它。偶尔，顶部爆炸，然后没有人能从弹片中安全，包括我们自己。

This is why we experience anger as such a destructive force in our world: because most of us get only halfway to the goal. We end up stuck in the middle phase, where our rage is painful, destructive, and useless, which means we either cause damage or shut down again so we won't. We never get to the good part, to the clarity and energy that alchemized rage can bring.

这就是为什么我们在世界中体验愤怒作为一种如此破坏性的力量：因为我们大多数人只达到目标的一半。我们最终被困在中间阶段，在那里我们的愤怒是痛苦的、破坏性的和无用的，这意味着我们要么造成伤害，要么再次关闭，这样我们就不会。我们从未到达好的部分，到达炼金术愤怒可以带来的清晰和能量。

Maybe you're terrified that if a leak springs in the fury you've spent the last forty years tamping down, you'll end up with a felony conviction, wearing a straitjacket or a necklace made from skulls. And it will feel dangerous to invite those unacceptable parts of yourself to the table; a god ignored is a demon born, as they say, and usually, when these hidden facets first emerge, they have a whole lot of ugly on them. ("You guys know that you're not actually supposed to kill people, right?" I once felt compelled to ask a group of students after a particularly gruesome Bad Girl Protocol.)

也许你害怕，如果你在过去四十年中一直压抑的愤怒中爆发泄漏，你最终会被判重罪，穿着约束衣或由头骨制成的项链。邀请那些不可接受的自己的部分到桌子上会感觉很危险；被忽视的神会生出一个恶魔，正如他们所说，通常，当这些隐藏的面貌首次出现时，它们身上有很多丑陋的东西。（"你们知道你们实际上不应该杀人，对吧？"在特别可怕的坏女孩准则之后，我曾经觉得有必要问一群学生。）

But once you've acknowledged them, it doesn't take much effort to clean them up, these hidden and denied aspects of ourselves. And the reward is enormous. Because when you unleash all the grief and anger and despair and violence inside of you, when you see and love and legitimize forbidden emotions like anger and fear and shame, you generate enough energy to light the Manhattan skyline. Free that energy up and it's yours to use! Move from numbness through the painful chaos of that middle phase, and on the other side is a laser focus—a vigor, lucidity, and the kind of powerful bodily presence that other people's bodies can't help but respond to with respect.

但一旦你承认了它们，清理它们并不需要太多努力，这些隐藏和被否认的我们自己。奖励是巨大的。因为当你释放你内心所有的悲伤、愤怒、绝望和暴力时，当你看到、爱并合法化像愤怒、恐惧和羞耻这样的被禁止的情绪时，你产生足够的能量来点亮曼哈顿的天际线。释放那些能量，它就是你的了！从麻木通过那个中间阶段的痛苦混乱，另一边是激光聚焦——一种活力、清晰度，以及那种强大的身体存在，其他人的身体忍不住以尊重回应。

If a woman goes around suppressing her emotions, then she's doing what men have been asked to do for centuries, and suffering in the very same way. She ends up accepting a dehumanized form of power—a power that's despite herself. And yet, the feeling that we have to override and deny our emotions to be seen as powerful is a myth that women in particular can be susceptible to.

如果一个女人到处压抑她的情绪，那么她正在做男人被要求做了几个世纪的事情，并以完全相同的方式受苦。她最终接受了一种非人性化的权力形式——一种违背她自己的权力。然而，我们必须覆盖和否认我们的情绪才能被视为强大的感觉是一个神话，女性特别容易受到这个神话的影响。

The key isn't suppression, but alignment—congruence. Bring the animal body along, and you uncork a tremendous energy source. Instead of cluttering the path and getting in your way, those valuable inner signals turn into tools, neatly laid out so that you can pick them up and use them when you need them.

关键不是压制，而是对齐——一致性。带上动物身体，你就打开了一个巨大的能量源。那些有价值的内在信号不会堵塞道路并阻碍你，而是变成工具，整齐地摆放，这样你就可以在需要时拿起并使用它们。

This technique of moving an emotion from its excluded, unusable form where it threatens to hijack your whole system to one where you draw untold energy from it is a powerful tool, one that smashes through the compression of the Smush.

这种将情绪从被排除、不可用的形式（它威胁要劫持你的整个系统）转变为你可以从中汲取无限能量的形式的技术是一个强大的工具，一个打破挤压压迫的工具。

It's called emotional alchemy.

它被称为情感炼金术。

#### EXERCISE | 练习

##### Things Unsaid | 未曾言说之事

Maybe you find yourself constantly losing your temper over the small stuff; maybe you feel like you're wrapped in a layer of thick cotton, not feeling much at all.

也许你发现自己经常对小事情发脾气；也许你感觉自己被一层厚厚的棉花包裹着，感觉不到什么。

The human experience is full of ecstasy, anger, sadness, doubt. It's time for us to harness the emotions a Good Girl is not supposed to have. It's time to say some of your Things Unsaid.

人类的经历充满了狂喜、愤怒、悲伤、怀疑。是时候让我们利用好女孩不应该拥有的情绪了。是时候说出你的一些未曾言说之事了。

These are the statements that rose up in your body but got stuck before they made it out into words. Whether you chose not to say them or couldn't, this is the place to empty that reservoir. The topics we are least willing to talk about are what get stuck—and the cause of our biggest problems.

这些是在你身体中升起但在它们变成话语之前被卡住的陈述。无论你选择不说还是不能说，这就是清空那个水库的地方。我们最不愿意谈论的话题就是被卡住的东西——也是我们最大问题的原因。

You will not have to say these things; you just need to know what they are.

你不需要说这些事情；你只需要知道它们是什么。

Write the following phrase at the top of a piece of paper:

在一张纸的顶部写下以下短语：

I never told ____________ about ____________.

我从未告诉 ____________ 关于 ____________。

Keep going until you've filled the page. Don't censor yourself, and include the big stuff as well as the small.

继续下去，直到你填满整页。不要审查自己，包括大事和小事。

There are a couple of variations on this exercise that may also be helpful to you:

这个练习有几个变体可能对你有帮助：

Do Things Unsaid, but for one person: your ex-husband; your coworker; your mom.

做未曾言说之事，但针对一个人：你的前夫；你的同事；你的妈妈。

Do Things Unsaid every day for a month. I tried this as an experiment with a class that had a lot of pent-up, unreleased feeling, and it was a revelation for students to realize how many times in the course of an ordinary day they silenced what they were feeling. By the end of the month, we discovered that doing this exercise for five minutes in the morning entirely changed how they moved through the world.

每天做未曾言说之事，持续一个月。我在一个有大量被压抑、未释放感觉的班级中尝试了这个实验，对学生来说，意识到在普通的一天中她们有多少次压制了自己的感受是一个启示。到月底，我们发现早上做这个练习五分钟完全改变了她们在世界中的移动方式。

Do Things Unsaid as a partner exercise. This may actually be the optimal way to do this exercise. (Indeed, many of the exercises in this book are best done in groups. See this page.) Here's how it works: You say, "I haven't told ___________ that ___________." Your partner does not coach or give advice or try to fix the problem; she says, "Thank you. What else haven't you said?" After five minutes, you switch.

作为配对练习做未曾言说之事。这实际上可能是做这个练习的最佳方式。（实际上，这本书中的许多练习最好在小组中完成。参见此页。）它的工作方式是：你说："我没有告诉 ___________  ___________。"你的伙伴不指导或给建议或试图解决问题；她说："谢谢你。你还有什么没说的？"五分钟后，你们交换。

Saying these words out loud to another person is one of the best ways to alchemize the anger—and to mitigate the haze of pain that tends to accompany the process. There is a very good reason that every religion has a form of the confessional: it is a primal human need to be heard, and for someone outside of us to bear witness with neutrality.

大声对另一个人说这些话是炼金愤怒的最佳方法之一——也是减轻往往伴随这个过程痛苦迷雾的最佳方法之一。每个宗教都有某种形式的忏悔有很好的理由：被听到是一种原始的人类需求，让外人以中立的方式见证。

Please do not use this exercise as an excuse to beat yourself up over the things you did not say. (Do not use any exercise in this book to self-attack.) Your Things Unsaid list is a victory, and should be celebrated as such: awareness brings choice, which brings freedom.

请不要使用这个练习作为借口，因为你没有说的话而责备自己。（不要使用这本书中的任何练习进行自我攻击。）你的未曾言说之事清单是一个胜利，应该这样庆祝：意识带来选择，选择带来自由。

In a book about radical change, it may seem counterintuitive to be told to do nothing. And yet that is exactly what you should do with your Things Unsaid.

在一本关于激进改变的书中，被告知什么都不做可能看起来违反直觉。然而，这正是你应该对你的未曾言说之事做的。

Simply by writing this list, and returning to update it periodically, you're already doing something. Now allow yourself the great gift of watching everything your awareness and attention can make happen.

仅仅通过写这个清单，并定期返回更新它，你已经在做一些事情了。现在允许自己这份伟大的礼物：观察你的意识和注意力能让一切发生。

### Invisible Labor, Revealed | 无形劳动，被揭示

Your Things Unsaid list could probably also be titled Things a Good Girl Wouldn't Say. And while you were listing yours, you may have noticed that all this silence also leads to a tremendous amount of hidden work.

你的未曾言说之事清单可能也可以被命名为《好女孩不会说的话》。当你列出你的清单时，你可能已经注意到所有这些沉默也导致了大量的隐藏工作。

Instead of saying, "You're an alcoholic and you need to leave my dinner party right now," the Good Girl makes a thousand accommodations. She'll rearrange the seating, leave an extra glass of water by the drunkard's elbow, and brightly ask "Who wants dessert?" after one of his sloppy rants—then quietly call to apologize to her guests the next day.

不是说"你是个酒鬼，你现在需要离开我的晚宴"，好女孩会做一千次调整。她会重新安排座位，在酒鬼的肘部留下一杯额外的水，在他的一次马虎的咆哮之后轻快地问"谁想要甜点？"——然后第二天悄悄地打电话向她的客人道歉。

Instead of asking her husband, "Do you mind being the primary wage-earner while I stay home with the kids?" the Good Girl compensates for her guilt by doing his company's bookkeeping, scouting for potential customers in her own social network, placating his most difficult clients, and bringing lunch to his staff—all without receiving a paycheck.

不是问她的丈夫"你介意在我和孩子们待在家里时成为主要的工资收入者吗？"好女孩通过做他公司的簿记、在她自己的社交网络中寻找潜在客户、安抚他最困难的客户、以及给他的员工带午餐来弥补她的内疚——所有这些都没有收到薪水。

Instead of asking her colleague, "Do you want to cut this shit out, or would you prefer that we take this to Human Resources?" the Good Girl invests in a wardrobe that doesn't show an inch of skin, finesses travel arrangements so she'll never have to be alone with him, then secretly starts looking for another job.

不是问她的同事"你想停止这种狗屎吗，还是你希望我们把这件事提交给人力资源部？"好女孩投资一套不露出一寸皮肤的衣橱，巧妙地安排旅行，这样她就永远不必和他单独在一起，然后秘密地开始寻找另一份工作。

Not all invisible labor arises from Things Unsaid. But invisible labor is a tremendous source of rage for women—rage that, most of the time, doesn't even get to surface.

并不是所有的无形劳动都来自于未曾言说之事。但无形劳动是女性愤怒的巨大来源——愤怒，大多数时候，甚至没有浮现。

One of the most surefire ways I have to rile up a class is to ask them to think of everything they do that they don't get directly credited, acknowledged, or compensated for—everything they do in their lives that isn't seen, that's taken for granted, that's not paid in kind. It's astonishing, the amount of time most women spend trying to prevent other people from making a mess, guessing at what other people are feeling, or comforting them after they've delivered a necessary correction.

我让课堂沸腾的最可靠方法之一是要求他们思考她们做的所有没有直接得到认可、承认或补偿的事情——她们在生活中做的所有不被看到、被视为理所当然、没有以实物支付的事情。令人震惊的是，大多数女性花费大量时间试图防止其他人制造混乱，猜测其他人的感受，或在她们提供必要的纠正后安慰他们。

Just as with hidden speech, all this invisible labor can turn rancid. If you are a first responder, the kind of person who responds immediately to a crisis, then you train the people around you to reach out the moment they have a problem. And in no time at all, you're surrounded by people who need you, not feed you. For some of us, this invisible labor makes up 80 percent of our work. No wonder we're exhausted all the time; no wonder we have no energy for our own passion projects, or even to think about what those might be.

就像隐藏的言语一样，所有这些无形劳动都会变质。如果你是第一响应者，那种立即响应危机的人，那么你训练你周围的人在他们有问题时立即联系。在很短的时间内，你被需要你的人包围，而不是喂养你的人。对我们中的一些人来说，这种无形劳动占我们工作的80%。难怪我们总是筋疲力尽；难怪我们没有精力投入自己的激情项目，甚至思考那些可能是什么。

Invisible labor can also be incredibly beautiful. I am not trying to tell you that you cannot stay late to tutor a student who's falling behind, pick up litter on your beach walk, or connect a friend who's starting a business with the investor who can make her dream happen. But awareness of what it is that you're doing, especially if your Good Girl auto-responder is jumping in before you've been asked to do anything all, is critical. Because

无形劳动也可能非常美丽。我不是在告诉你你不能熬夜辅导一个落后的学生，在海滩散步时捡垃圾，或者将一个开始创业的朋友与能够实现她梦想的投资者联系起来。但意识到你在做什么，特别是如果你的好女孩自动响应器在你被要求做任何事情之前就跳出来，这是关键的。因为

with awareness comes choice.

有了意识就有了选择。

#### EXERCISE | 练习

##### Invisible Labor | 隐形劳动

Think of all the things you do that are outside the scope of your actual paid work, especially the things you do without even being asked—either because they're expected, or because your responsiveness to a need is so heartfelt and fast that you nurture or help someone before they've even had a chance to formulate a request.

想想你做的所有超出你实际有薪工作范围的事情，特别是那些你甚至没有被要求就做的事情——要么是因为它们被期望，要么是因为你对需求的响应是如此真诚和快速，以至于你在他们甚至有机会制定请求之前就培养或帮助了某人。

Does your partner think the laundry does itself? Are your colleagues more careless than they should be, because they know you'll catch their mistakes? Who plans the gallery opening, then runs out to buy wine? Who decorates the house for the holidays? Who found the marriage counselor? Who booked the appointment?

你的伴侣认为洗衣物是自己做的吗？你的同事是否比他们应该的更加粗心，因为他们知道你会发现他们的错误？谁计划画廊开幕式，然后跑出去买酒？谁为假期装饰房子？谁找到了婚姻顾问？谁预约了？

Just today: What did you think about? What did you do? Where did the bulk of your mental, physical, and emotional energy go? How much of what you did and thought and worried about was for you, and how much of it was for someone else? How much of it is something that you can expect to be reciprocated, without needing to ask? How much of it would you like to be reciprocated, even though you haven't asked? How much of it was credited, and how much of it stayed unseen? How much of it remained invisible, even to the person who benefited the most?

就今天：你想了什么？你做了什么？你的大部分心理、身体和情感能量去了哪里？你做的、想的和担心的有多少是为了你自己，有多少是为了别人？有多少是你可以期望得到回报的，而不需要问？有多少是你希望得到回报的，即使你没有问过？有多少得到了认可，有多少保持不被看见？有多少保持无形，甚至对受益最大的人来说也是如此？

When you start seeing this labor as the labor it is, you can start making choices about whether or not you want to do it. What's working for you—and what isn't?

当你开始将这个劳动视为它所是的劳动时，你可以开始选择是否想做它。什么对你有用——什么不行？

Simply recognizing how much invisible labor you do can be incredibly liberating, in and of itself. But once you start becoming aware of this invisible labor as a choice you are making, then the people around you start to see it too.

仅仅认识到你做了多少无形劳动本身就是令人难以置信的解放。但一旦你开始意识到这种无形劳动是你正在做出的选择，那么你周围的人也开始看到它。

And when you start acknowledging all the invisible labor you do, and giving yourself credit for it (even when others don't), it gets easier to ask anybody for anything at any time. If you are the kind of person who doesn't feel you have the right to ask for anything, that will start to shift when you begin seeing the work you do as work—as opposed to the tax you pay just for being female on the planet.

当你开始承认你做的所有无形劳动，并为此给自己信用（即使其他人没有），在任何时候向任何人要求任何事情都会变得更容易。如果你是那种不觉得自己有权要求任何事情的人，当你开始将你做的视为工作——而不是仅仅因为在这个星球上是女性而支付的税款时，这种情况就会开始改变。

The skills to ask will come in a later chapter. But for now, treasure this newfound awareness, and celebrate every time you notice yourself embarking on an act of invisible labor, and every time you choose whether or not to do it. With each choice you make, that labor goes from being an automatic performance to an intentional act of love, or the decision to prioritize yourself.

要求的技能将在后面的章节中介绍。但现在，珍惜这种新发现的意识，并庆祝每一次你注意到自己开始进行无形劳动的行为，以及每一次你选择是否要做它。随着你做出的每一个选择，这种劳动从自动表演变成了有意的爱的行为，或者优先考虑自己的决定。

Your Book of Desires will be a great ally as you start to negotiate the time and space that gets freed up when you make your invisible labor visible. Return to it—both to add items and as a source of inspiration.

当你开始协商当你让无形劳动可见时释放的时间和空间时，你的欲望之书将是一个很好的盟友。回到它——既是为了添加项目，也是作为灵感的来源。

#### EXERCISE | 练习

##### Conversations I'm Not Having | 我没有进行的对话

You may be having a lot of big feelings by now: this is appropriate for the chaotic middle phase. In this swirl of emotions, it's totally logical that there would be themes and conversations emerging that you know you should have with the people in your life.

现在你可能有很多强烈的感觉：这对混乱的中间阶段是合适的。在这种情绪的漩涡中，出现一些你知道应该与你生活中的人进行的主题和对话是完全合理的。

Having those conversations is best done when you've reached a point of clarity, but note them now; the chaos of the middle phase is when they start to make themselves known.

进行这些对话最好在你达到清晰点时进行，但现在记录它们；中间阶段的混乱是它们开始自我显现的时候。

Again: these are not conversations you will have to have. As with beginning to recognize invisible labor and the Things Unsaid exercise, we are first bringing these issues to our own attention and documenting them. (Though it often happens that students find these themes emerge organically, after they do the exercise.) When I have given you the tools you need to have these difficult conversations, you will get to decide whether to have them or not. For now, logging them is enough.

再次：这些不是你必须进行的对话。就像开始识别无形劳动和未曾言说之事练习一样，我们首先将这些问题带入我们自己的注意力并记录它们。（虽然经常发生的是，学生在做完练习后，发现这些主题有机地出现。）当我给你进行这些困难对话所需的工具时，你将决定是否进行它们。现在，记录它们就足够了。

Write the following sentence at the top of the page:

在页面顶部写下以下句子：

I'm not having a conversation with _____ about _____.

我没有与 _____ 关于 _____ 进行对话。

For example:

例如：

I'm not having a conversation with my kid about how she never empties the dishwasher without being asked.

我没有与我的孩子进行关于她从未在未被要求的情况下清空洗碗机的对话。

I'm not having a conversation with my mother about my sister inheriting our childhood home.

我没有与我的母亲进行关于我姐姐继承我们童年家园的对话。

Create as many entries as you can.

尽可能多地创建条目。

After you've finished your list, do a separate pass for conversations you're not having around money, and conversations you're not having around sex.

完成清单后，分别列出你没有进行的关于金钱的对话，以及你没有进行的关于性的对话。

### Locate, Approve, Influence | 定位、批准、影响

What feelings came up for you when you wrote your list of Conversations I'm Not Having?

当你写你的《我没有进行的对话》清单时，你产生了什么感觉？

Locate these feelings; name them. Did you feel helplessness, hopelessness, fury, sadness, sickness, frustration, a desire for vengeance, glee? All of the above?

定位这些感觉；命名它们。你感到无助、绝望、愤怒、悲伤、恶心、挫败、报复的欲望、喜悦吗？以上所有？

Approve of whatever feelings came up. By approval, I don't mean accepting the emotion; I mean accepting the fact that it exists. Let's say one of the feelings that came up is a crappy one: jealousy, for instance, or resentment. Approving of that feeling doesn't mean condoning it. It doesn't mean resigning yourself to the fact that it's never going to change. It simply means resigning yourself to the fact of what is—what is happening right now. Pretending that something else is happening—telling yourself that you feel grateful because you should, when in fact you feel really sad—is denial.

批准出现的任何感觉。通过批准，我不是指接受情绪；我是指接受它存在的事实。假设出现的感觉之一是一个糟糕的：例如，嫉妒或怨恨。批准那种感觉并不意味着纵容它。它并不意味着屈服于它永远不会改变的事实。它只是意味着屈服于什么是——现在正在发生什么的事实。假装别的东西正在发生——告诉自己你感到感激因为你应该，而实际上你感到非常悲伤——是拒绝。

When you disapprove of the existence of a feeling that's come up, you disconnect from it and have no influence over it. It's only when you acknowledge what's actually there that you stand a chance to say where that energy goes and how. That's influence.

当你不批准出现的感觉的存在时，你会与它断开联系，并且对它没有影响。只有当你承认实际存在的东西时，你才有机会说那种能量去哪里以及如何。那就是影响。

The magic word I use with myself is "Welcome." If I do the Bad Girl Protocol and a homicidal maniac shows up, a Valkyrie who wants to take a bullwhip to most of Congress? I say, "Welcome." A pathetic, whining little girl, who's overwhelmed and just wants someone to take it all off my plate so I can be alone and rest? "Welcome." The Good Girl people-pleaser who wants to say yes and impress and satisfy others, even though it means overextending myself? "Welcome."

我对自己使用的神奇词是"欢迎"。如果我做坏女孩准则，一个杀人狂出现，一个想要用牛鞭鞭打国会大部分人的女武神？我说："欢迎。"一个可怜的、抱怨的小女孩，她被压倒了，只是希望有人把所有东西从我的盘子里拿走，这样我可以独自休息？"欢迎。"想要说"是"并给人留下深刻印象并满足其他人的好女孩讨好者，即使这意味着过度扩展自己？"欢迎。"

Anxiety is unalchemized enthusiasm; worry is unalchemized care; sadness can signal a return to yourself, and expose a desire for more of the tender things in life.

焦虑是未炼金的热情；担忧是未炼金的关怀；悲伤可能标志着回到你自己，并暴露对生活中更温柔事物的渴望。

Rage is unalchemized passion—absolutely a force for good, if it wakes people up to the truth in the world.

愤怒是未炼金的激情——绝对是善的力量，如果它唤醒人们对世界真理的认识。

There is no such thing as a vice or a virtue, only the role that you give it. You can work with anything that comes up, as long as it's not buried. Get in contact with an emotion, and you can steer it—use it. Suppress it, and it will run amok.

没有恶习或美德这样的东西，只有你给它的角色。你可以与出现的任何东西合作，只要它没有被埋葬。与情绪接触，你可以引导它——使用它。压制它，它会失控。

### Fighting Against to Fighting For | 从对抗到争取

Conversations I'm Not Having invariably pulls back the curtain on feelings you've been avoiding—and on some pretty juicy desires, too. You likely didn't write, "I'm not having a conversation with Susan about the rings of Saturn"—because unless you're an astrophysicist with strong opinions about gaseous planets, there's no rage you're suppressing around that conversation, and no desire, either. But when you look at your own list, I'd bet that every entry is a little undetonated bomb of both.

《我没有进行的对话》不可避免地揭开了你一直在回避的感觉——以及一些相当诱人的欲望。你可能没有写"我没有与苏珊进行关于土星环的对话"——因为除非你是一个对气态行星有强烈观点的天体物理学家，否则你不会在那次对话周围压制愤怒，也没有欲望。但当你查看你自己的清单时，我打赌每个条目都是两者的一个小未爆炸炸弹。

Avoidance is a form of protection. We protect what's meaningful to us. So the conversations you're avoiding are filled with information about what's important to you, what's tender and painful and in need of protection. Use your Conversations to create a few new entries in your Book of Desires. Just as you mined your complaints for hidden desires, investigate these conversations you're not having for longings.

回避是一种保护形式。我们保护对我们有意义的东西。所以你正在回避的对话充满了关于什么对你重要、什么是温柔和痛苦以及需要保护的信息。使用你的对话在你的欲望之书中创建一些新条目。就像你从抱怨中挖掘隐藏的欲望一样，调查这些你没有进行的对话的渴望。

Include a few concrete and specific ways you would know that the desire had been manifested. Some of these will be straightforward: "I would finally know exactly how much money we have in our joint savings account." But how would you know your dad respected you? What could he do that would give you that feeling?

包括一些具体和具体的方式，你会知道欲望已经显现。其中一些将是直接的："我终于会确切知道我们在联合储蓄账户中有多少钱。"但你怎么知道你的父亲尊重你？他能做什么来给你那种感觉？

Approve also of the fact that you haven't (yet) had these conversations! Maybe you don't have enough information, or you're afraid, or you don't know how. The training you'll receive will move you through all of the spaces and skills you will need to have in order to have conversations; logging them early is a fantastic benchmark. There will be lots of time to acknowledge and celebrate the process and the progress you're going to make.

也批准你还没有（还）进行这些对话的事实！也许你没有足够的信息，或者你害怕，或者你不知道如何。你将接受的培训将引导你完成进行对话所需的所有空间和技能；提前记录它们是一个很好的基准。将有很多时间来承认和庆祝你将经历的过程和进步。

Moving through this arc—from numbness, through rage, to a new clarity and energy around our desires—allows us to create transformation in ourselves, and in the world. What comes next is accessing the kind of power that will make those conversations possible—and that protection unnecessary.

通过这个弧线——从麻木，通过愤怒，到围绕我们欲望的新清晰和能量——允许我们在我们自己和世界中创造转变。接下来是获得将使那些对话成为可能的力量——以及使那种保护变得不必要。

This process of taking an unspoken, unacknowledged, suppressed emotion and shining light on it so it becomes acknowledged, located, and approved of is how we get from that chaotic middle phase to the final stage of clarity and power.

这个将未说出口、未被承认、被压制的情绪并为其照明，使其被承认、定位和批准的过程，是我们如何从那个混乱的中间阶段到达清晰和力量的最后阶段。

Another way to think about this: We are moving from what we're fighting against to the thing we're fighting for.

另一种思考方式是：我们正在从我们对抗的东西转向我们争取的东西。

Desire is our link to what we care about, what we're willing to fight for.

欲望是我们与我们在乎的东西、我们愿意为之奋斗的东西的联系。

We cannot afford to forget the love that lives inside of rage.

我们不能忘记生活在愤怒中的爱。

You're not fighting against your roommate's messiness; you're fighting for a space that's beautiful and well cared for where you work on your photography, as well as for better communication with the person you live with. You're not fighting against the office bully, but for a workplace where everyone feels safe to brainstorm big. You're not fighting against sex trafficking, but for the recognition and protection of the human rights of little girls around the world.

你不是在对抗你室友的混乱；你在为一个美丽且得到良好照顾的空间而战，在那里你进行摄影工作，以及与和你住在一起的人更好地沟通。你不是在对抗办公室恶霸，而是在为一个每个人都能安全地进行大型头脑风暴的工作场所而战。你不是在对抗性交易，而是在为世界各地小女孩的人权得到承认和保护而战。

Rage is everything you're fighting against, the pins-and-needles phase of waking up a limb that's fallen asleep. Complete the arc, and you'll see that rage was really a desire trying to make itself known—what you're fighting for. And we can use the clarity and energy we find in our rage to give us direction. It may seem dangerous to lean into our anger, but we don't get powerful by unplugging; we get powerful by tapping into the current.

愤怒是你对抗的一切，唤醒睡着肢体的针刺阶段。完成弧线，你会看到愤怒实际上是一个试图让自己被知道的欲望——你为之奋斗的东西。我们可以使用我们在愤怒中找到的清晰和能量来给我们方向。深入我们的愤怒可能看起来很危险，但我们不是通过断开连接来获得力量；我们通过接入电流来获得力量。

Connecting to our desire—and acquiring the skills to get those desires met—is what transforms that rage into power.

连接到我们的欲望——并获得满足这些欲望的技能——是将愤怒转化为力量的东西。

It is a powerful thing to fight against police brutality. But it's even more powerful to fight for the sanctity of the lives of innocent men and women, and for a justice system that works equally well for all races. The dream of what that world would look like will move you—and whoever joins you in your crusade—much further than wanting to overcome police brutality will.

对抗警察暴行是一件强大的事情。但更强大的是为无辜男女生活的神圣性而战，以及为一个对所有种族同样有效的司法系统而战。那个世界会是什么样子的梦想会推动你——以及任何加入你的事业的人——比想要克服警察暴行会推动得更远。

"Fighting against" is the middle phase. We're taught to stop there, to smash our head against the obstacle, to lock our attention onto what we don't want, instead of looking to what's beyond the wall. But there's always going to be more juice in what you do want, what you're fighting for. And almost always, we find the desire we're fighting for is way bigger and more inspiring.

"对抗"是中间阶段。我们被教导在那里停止，用我们的头撞击障碍，将我们的注意力锁定在我们不想要的东西上，而不是看向墙外的东西。但你想要的东西、你为之奋斗的东西总是会有更多的能量。几乎总是如此，我们发现我们为之奋斗的欲望要大得多，更有启发性。

Figuring out what we are fighting for changes our orientation—it angles us toward vision, not obstacle. The problem of what we're fighting against still gets tackled, but it does so while we're on our way to something bigger and better: our greatest, greediest dreams for ourselves and for humanity—everything worth fighting for.

弄清楚我们在争取什么会改变我们的方向——它使我们朝向愿景，而不是障碍。我们对抗的问题仍然得到处理，但它是在我们走向更大更好的东西的路上这样做的：我们为自己和人类的最大、最贪婪的梦想——一切值得为之奋斗的东西。
