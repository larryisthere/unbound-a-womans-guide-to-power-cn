# Chapter 07: SOLID AS A ROCK | 第七章：坚如磐石

## The Power of Legitimacy | 正当性的力量

A woman raised her hand after watching a demonstration I'd done with Ruben, cofounder of The Academy and my verbal sparring partner in class. We'd staged a fight where his only job was to say "No!" to me, no matter how convincing I am.

一个女人在看到我与鲁本（学院的共同创始人，也是我在课堂上的口头对练伙伴）做的演示后举起了手。我们上演了一场斗争，他的唯一工作就是对我说"不！"，无论我多么有说服力。

"I'm pretty sure I'd cave the second or third time he said no," she confessed. "How do you hold the line?"

"我很确定在他第二次或第三次说不时我会屈服，"她承认。"你如何坚持立场？"

I asked her what she did for a living, and she told me that she was a nanny. So I asked: "What would you say if a total stranger walked up to you in the park and said, 'I'm going to take this little boy you're taking care of for a walk, just the two of us. Would that be okay?'"

我问她以什么为生，她告诉我她是一名保姆。所以我问："如果一个完全陌生的人在公园里走到你面前说：'我要带这个你照顾的小男孩去散步，只有我们两个。可以吗？'你会说什么？"

"Absolutely not," she said, without a second's pause.

"绝对不行，"她说，没有片刻的停顿。

I tried again: "Maybe I'll just take him over there, behind that building with the bathrooms. Would that be okay?"

我又试了一次："也许我只是把他带到那里，在带浴室的那栋楼后面。可以吗？"

The class was laughing by that point at the outrageousness of the scenario, and she was too—unless you were watching her body, which was locked and loaded. Her brain knew I was messing with her; her body was poised to tear my throat out.

到那时，课堂上的每个人都在为这个场景的荒谬而笑，她也是——除非你在观察她的身体，它已经锁定了，准备就绪。她的大脑知道我在戏弄她；她的身体准备好撕开我的喉咙。

My point is this: There was nothing that anyone on earth could have said that would have convinced her to let some random stranger take that little boy out of her sight.

我的观点是：世界上没有人能说什么能说服她让某个随机陌生人把那个小男孩带离她的视线。

Do you see how incredibly powerful that is?

你看到那是多么强大的力量吗？

Now imagine that what she was protecting wasn't the child in her care—but her dream of being a sculptor, or her organization's vision for housing justice. Imagine feeling so completely sure of the correctness of your conviction that there's no argument on earth that could persuade you to dump that dream.

现在想象她保护的不是她照顾的孩子——而是她成为雕塑家的梦想，或者她的组织对住房正义的愿景。想象一下，你如此完全确信你的信念的正确性，以至于世界上没有任何论点可以说服你放弃那个梦想。

That is how rock-solid I want you to feel about your desires.

这就是我希望你对自己的欲望感到坚如磐石的方式。

This is legitimacy—the true superpower of the sub state.

这就是正当性——顺从状态的真正超能力。

### The Unshakable Self-Knowledge of the Submissive State | 顺从状态不可动摇的自我认知

What does legitimacy have to do with submission?

正当性与顺从有什么关系？

In order to know exactly what you want and how you want it, you have to go inside. When you turn your attention inward and connect to what you want—exactly what it will taste and smell like, feel like, and what will change when you have it—then you give yourself permission to take it seriously.

为了确切知道你想要什么以及你想要它的方式，你必须向内探索。当你将注意力向内转并连接到你想要的东西——确切地说它尝起来和闻起来会是什么样子，感觉会是什么样子，以及当你拥有它时会发生什么变化——然后你给自己许可认真对待它。

You need that permission to confess your desire, to express it, to expand it—and to communicate it to someone else with the full weight of your desire behind it. Women's conditioning—all the rules that tell us it's not okay to be dissatisfied or horny or hungry or mad—weakens our connection to desire. And if we can't feel it fully, we can't transmit the richest version—one we feel in our bodies, and that the other person can feel in theirs.

你需要那种许可来承认你的欲望，表达它，扩展它——并将它以你欲望的全部力量传达给其他人。女性的条件反射——所有告诉我们不满意、性兴奋、饥饿或生气是不对的规则——削弱了我们对欲望的连接。如果我们不能完全感受到它，我们就不能传达最丰富的版本——一个我们在身体中感受到的版本，另一个人的身体也能感受到的版本。

Most men don't have a problem feeling or conveying legitimacy. In fact, when we talk about male privilege, one of the things we are describing is their sense of legitimacy. Men don't ask permission to ask, as women do (the infamous "Can I ask a question?"). Often, men don't even bother asking; they simply tell you what's going to happen next.

大多数男人在感受或传达正当性方面没有问题。事实上，当我们谈论男性特权时，我们描述的事情之一就是他们的正当性感。男人不像女人那样请求许可来提问（臭名昭著的"我能问个问题吗？"）。通常，男人甚至不屑于问；他们只是告诉你接下来会发生什么。

When you feel legitimate about a desire, you are 100 percent connected to the feeling of wanting it.

当你对一个欲望感到正当时，你百分之百地连接到想要它的感觉。

Can you imagine what it would be like if we lived in a world where people felt what they wanted? They didn't just know, in some arm's-length, theoretical way, but connected to it as a burning need, completely embodied.

你能想象如果生活在一个人们感受到他们想要的东西的世界里会是什么样子吗？他们不只是以某种保持距离、理论的方式知道，而是将其连接为一种燃烧的需要，完全体现。

What legitimacy does to our bodies, and the energy we transmit, cannot be quantified. When I met my first female Taoist teacher, one of the most esteemed abbots in China, I was blown away by her physical presence, and by the bodies of the nuns around her. She was so grounded—so rooted—that her small body felt to me like the visible tip of a massive tree, its roots buried a hundred feet into the ground. When she walked, it was as if the earth walked with her.

正当性对我们的身体和我们传递的能量所起的作用无法量化。当我遇到我的第一位女性道教老师，中国最受尊敬的住持之一时，她的身体存在以及她周围修女的身体让我震惊。她是如此扎根——如此扎根——以至于她小小的身体对我来说就像一棵巨大树木的可见尖端，它的根深埋在地下100英尺。当地走路时，仿佛大地与她同行。

And although she and the other nuns were part of a celibate sect, her rootedness contained a surprising quality: it had an immense erotic power. Not a superficially sexy performance of female eroticism, but the real thing: life force. Her vitality was stunning.

尽管她和其他修女是独身教派的一部分，但她的扎根包含了一个令人惊讶的品质：它拥有巨大的性魅力。不是表面的性感的女性色情表演，而是真实的东西：生命力。她的活力令人震惊。

I couldn't help but compare her body to the bodies of so many of the women I knew back home—how they dressed themselves in apology, how high and shallow their breathing was, and how much tightness and compression they carried. Looking at her showed me the invisible restraints binding most of the women I knew.

我忍不住将她身体与我在家乡认识的许多女性的身体进行比较——她们如何用道歉的方式穿着自己，她们的呼吸是多么高和浅，以及她们携带了多少紧张和压迫。看着她向我展示了束缚我认识的大多数女性的无形束缚。

And looking at this nun's body—feeling it—I had no trouble at all believing the legend many people had told me about her. In the 1960s and 70s, the Communist army destroyed many ancient temples and monasteries in China. But as the army gathered on the mountainside, preparing to storm her abbey, she appeared above them on a narrow outcropping.

看着这个修女的身体——感受它——我完全相信许多人告诉我的关于她的传说。在1960年代和70年代，共产党军队摧毁了中国许多古老的寺庙和修道院。但当军队聚集在山坡上，准备袭击她的修道院时，她出现在他们上方的一个狭窄的突出岩石上。

She just stood there; she didn't say a word. And the army turned tail and ran.

她只是站在那里；她一句话也没说。军队掉头跑了。

This is what I mean by legitimacy. It is deeply rooted, it is embodied, and the truth it carries is completely unmovable.

这就是我所说的正当性。它是深深扎根的，它是体现的，它携带的真理是完全不可移动的。

### Asking for the Right to Ask at All | 要求提出要求的权利

Asking with legitimacy for something doesn't necessarily mean that you are convinced you're going to get it. But it does mean that you know, at a cellular level, that you have the right to ask for it.

以正当性要求某物并不一定意味着你确信你会得到它。但这确实意味着你知道，在细胞层面上，你有权要求它。

Good Girl prohibitions against desire—against wanting, and against asking—can muddy these waters. So it may sound like you're asking your boss for a promotion. But what you're really asking, and what your supervisor's animal body is responding to, is whether you're entitled to ask for one at all. Sometimes this even makes its way into the language we use: "Can I ask you a question?"

好女孩对欲望的禁令——对想要的禁令，以及对要求的禁令——可能会混淆这些水域。所以听起来你可能在向你的老板要求升职。但你真正要求的，以及你主管的动物身体正在回应的，是你是否有权提出要求。有时这甚至会出现在我们使用的语言中："我能问你一个问题吗？"

I call these "meta-asks." These meta-asks make it much more difficult for the other person to reply honestly, especially if they want to say no—because they know, as you do, that saying no isn't just saying no to your request for a date or a promotion or a seat on the subway, but to the premise of your very existence. Not surprisingly, when someone does say no to you when you're in that state, even if they have a valid reason for doing so, it feels like they're annihilating you. And if they do say yes to avoid the discomfort of harming you, it's much more likely to be a false yes—an agreement they're going to waffle or pull back from as soon as your back is turned.

我称这些为"元要求"。这些元要求使对方更难诚实地回应，特别是如果他们想说"不"——因为他们知道，就像你知道的那样，说"不"不仅仅是对你的约会或升职或地铁座位要求的拒绝，而是对你存在前提的拒绝。毫不奇怪，当有人在那种状态下对你说"不"时，即使他们有合理的理由这样做，感觉就像他们在消灭你。如果他们为了避免伤害你的不适而说"是"，那更可能是虚假的"是"——一个他们会在你转身后就动摇或撤回的协议。

Because these requests tend to be unsuccessful (either you don't get what you want or you get what you want and nobody feels good about it), communicating this way creates a negative feedback loop, one that cannot help but continue to erode your confidence.

因为这些请求往往不成功（要么你得不到你想要的，要么你得到了你想要的，但没有人对此感觉良好），这样沟通会创建一个负面反馈循环，一个无法避免地继续侵蚀你信心的循环。

After all, the person you're talking to isn't the only person affected by the energetics of the Smush! Bracing for a no, qualifying our desires, or lying about them—these broadcast weakness and doubt and confusion to your own nervous system as well as to the person you're talking to. Asking without legitimacy stirs up all of your own worst fears: that you don't have the right to ask for what you've asked for, that the person is going to say no, that everyone always says no, that you're alone and it's always going to be that way.

毕竟，和你说话的人并不是唯一受到挤压能量影响的人！为"不"做准备，限定我们的欲望，或对它们撒谎——这些向你的神经系统以及与你说话的人广播了软弱、怀疑和困惑。没有正当性的要求会激起你自己最糟糕的恐惧：你没有权利要求你要求的，那个人会说"不"，每个人总是说"不"，你是孤独的，它总是会是这样。

By contrast, a congruent request creates a connection, which in turn creates allies, and leads to intimacy and collaboration. A congruent ask feels good, to both of you.

相比之下，一个一致的请求创造连接，这反过来创造盟友，并导致亲密和合作。一个一致的请求对你们双方来说都感觉良好。

Legitimacy even takes the sting out of no. Because you're not relying on anyone else to confer validity on your request, a rejection of your invitation doesn't register as a fatal wound. Instead, that no is transformed into a piece of relevant data—often, a source of excitement, and one that leaves open the possibility of a longer conversation.

正当性甚至消除了"不"的刺痛。因为你不再依赖其他任何人来赋予你请求的有效性，对你邀请的拒绝不会被视为致命伤害。相反，那个"不"被转化为一个相关数据——通常是兴奋的来源，也是一个为更长对话留下可能性的来源。

Feeling legitimate about your desire is the first step toward congruence.

对你的欲望感到正当是走向一致性的第一步。

### Legitimacy Is Permission | 正当性就是许可

Maybe you read the words "You have no say in what you want," and felt the truth of them on an intellectual level. But we can't get anywhere unless we're bringing our bodies along. Your brain doesn't need convincing; she's read all the books on empowerment, heard all the brilliant women give their TED Talks and explain their theories on podcasts. Strengthening your legitimacy lets the rest of you know that it's okay to want what you want.

也许你读了"你对想要什么没有发言权"这句话，并在智力层面上感受到了它们的真实。但除非我们带着我们的身体一起，否则我们无法取得任何进展。你的大脑不需要说服；她已经读过所有关于赋权的书，听过所有聪明的女性发表TED演讲并在播客上解释他们的理论。加强你的正当性让其他部分的你知道想要你想要的是可以的。

This profoundly impacts how other people read you, even when you're not speaking. Think of a time you were incredibly stressed out. The number-one gesture someone else could offer to change your channel is a hug. You love hugs! But you're so incredibly jangly and revved up that a hug is the very last thing they could imagine giving you. They might try anyway—you might even ask for one!—but to do so, they're going to have to push their own body to climb across some pretty scary vibes. This shows how our energetics can work against us, and how legitimacy confers permission. It's the nonverbal permission other people need to give you what you want. And it gives you permission to want what you want.

这深刻地影响其他人如何解读你，即使你没有说话。想想你非常紧张的时候。别人可以提供来改变你的频道的第一手势是拥抱。你爱拥抱！但你是如此令人难以置信地紧张和兴奋，以至于拥抱是他们能想象给你的最后一件事。他们可能还是会尝试——你甚至可能会要求一个！——但这样做，他们将不得不推动他们自己的身体爬过一些相当可怕的氛围。这表明我们的能量如何对我们不利，以及正当性如何赋予许可。这是其他人需要给你的非语言许可，给你你想要的东西。它给你许可想要你想要的东西。

How many times have students told me that they were offered exactly what they wanted, and yet still found themselves saying no, faster than they could catch themselves?

有多少次学生告诉我，他们得到了他们想要的东西，但发现自己说"不"，快得他们来不及抓住自己？

Why on earth does this happen?

这到底为什么会发生？

We say no to the thing we most want because we've already negotiated against ourselves and made peace with ourselves about not getting it. We've already made the case for why we don't get to have it, and why we're going to have to make do without it. It may be exactly what we want, but we've already set the course for not having it, so our quick answer is, "No, I'm fine."

我们对我们最想要的东西说"不"，因为我们已经与自己谈判并对自己没有它达成了和平。我们已经为为什么我们不能拥有它，以及为什么我们必须没有它而做出案例。它可能正是我们想要的，但我们已经设定了没有它的路线，所以我们的快速回答是，"不，我很好。"

It happens in seconds—a knee-jerk. And the only way around it is preparing to receive, which is important for many reasons. Getting something you want is a big deal! And it can be a big deal in an intense, not-wonderful way, if you're not properly prepared. Think of a bride, rampaging on her perfect wedding day, or the huge percentage of lottery winners who lose it all in the first two years, or the hundreds of celebrities whose sudden rise destroyed them from the inside out.

它在几秒钟内发生——一种条件反射。解决它的唯一方法是准备接收，这很重要，原因很多。得到你想要的东西是一件大事！如果你没有适当准备，它可能是一件激烈的、不太好的大事。想想一个新娘，在她完美的婚礼当天暴怒，或者在第一两年失去一切的彩票中奖者的巨大比例，或者数百名突然崛起从内到外摧毁他们的名人。

Getting what you want changes the landscape of your life. Feeling legitimate about it beforehand means that you've envisioned that altered landscape before the Ask is made, before the surprise offer comes—not only so you don't accidentally reject it, but so that your life is already oriented and adjusted toward having it, incorporating it, enjoying it, and using it fully.

得到你想要的东西会改变你生活的风景。事先对它有正当感意味着你在提出要求之前、在惊喜提议到来之前就已经设想了那个改变的风景——不仅是为了你不会意外地拒绝它，而且是为了你的生活已经朝向并调整到拥有它、融入它、享受它并充分利用它。

### It's Okay for Them to Say No! | 他们说不没关系！

The words you speak carry information, and your body tells the other person how to feel about that information. When you ask someone for something, sure that they're going to say no to you, you brace energetically against the no you think is coming.

你说的话传递信息，你的身体告诉另一个人如何感受这些信息。当你向某人要求某物时，确信他们会对你说"不"，你在能量上准备好对抗你认为即将到来的"不"。

This negatively affects your Ask. Even if you're asking for something that would make you truly, truly happy, when you presume the answer will be no, then your body broadcasts a flinch.

这会对你的要求产生负面影响。即使你在要求一些会让你真正、真正快乐的东西，当你假设答案会是"不"时，你的身体会广播一种退缩。

What this transmits energetically is that he's hurt you already. There's already something he has to feel bad about, something to make up for. Which also means that he won't feel safe saying no, even if he wants to. So he may dodge or avoid the question, or agree to something he doesn't want to do—and then flake out later.

这在能量上传递的是他已经伤害了你。已经有一些他必须感到糟糕的东西，一些需要弥补的东西。这也意味着他不会感到安全说"不"，即使他想这样做。所以他可能会躲避或避免这个问题，或者同意一些他不想做的事情——然后后来退出。

And if he wants to say yes, you've stripped the pleasure from it by asking like he was going to say no. This is the result of bracing against no, even if your request is something he wants to comply with.

如果他想要说"是"，你通过以他将会说"不"的方式提问而剥夺了其中的快乐。这是为"不"做准备的结果，即使你的请求是他想要遵守的东西。

This is familiar, isn't it? I'm sure you can easily call to mind a scenario where you were asked for something you would have happily given, but the way the person asked pissed you right off and made you want to say no instead. That's because their request wasn't congruent. Even if you did say yes, you did so over the protests of your animal body, which is why the exchange felt so bad.

这很熟悉，不是吗？我确定你可以很容易地想起一个场景，你被要求一些你本来会乐意给的东西，但那个人提问的方式让你非常生气，让你想说"不"而不是"是"。那是因为他们的请求不一致。即使你确实说了"是"，你这样做也是违背了你动物身体的抗议，这就是为什么交换感觉如此糟糕。

This plays out very differently if the person asking feels entitled to ask. (Note that I said entitled to ask, not necessarily entitled to have the desire met.) When you're no longer asking if it's okay to want the thing you're asking for—if you're not really asking, Good Girl–style, if it's okay for you to exist, or to have desires at all—then the other person can answer honestly, even if that answer is no, without feeling like they're killing you.

如果提问的人感到有权提问，这就会表现得非常不同。（注意我说的是有权提问，不一定有权让欲望得到满足。）当你不再问想要你要求的东西是否可以——如果你不是在真正地问，好女孩风格，你是否可以存在，或者是否可以有欲望——那么对方可以诚实地回答，即使答案是"不"，而不觉得他们在杀死你。

In order to get to yes, the person you're asking has to feel it's okay for them to say no.

为了得到"是"，你提问的人必须感到说"不"对他们来说是可以的。

It's only when they feel like they have the right to say no that they will feel safe enough to reveal why their answer is no. That's the information you will need to achieve influence—to get to a yes, or to something better.

只有当他们感到他们有权说"不"时，他们才会感到足够安全来揭示为什么他们的答案是"不"。这就是你需要实现影响力所需的信息——得到"是"，或者得到更好的东西。

### Protect Your Dreams | 保护你的梦想

Legitimacy also allows you to safeguard and protect the desires that are most important to you.

正当性还允许你保护和守卫对你最重要的欲望。

When you feel completely connected to what you want, and allow yourself to pour all of yourself into feeling it—physically, emotionally, at the very deepest level—then you will immediately feel when your precious charges are threatened, just as my student did when I was pretending to creep on the child in her care.

当你完全连接到你想要的东西，并允许自己全身心地投入到感受它——在身体上、情感上，在最深的层面上——那么当你的珍贵任务受到威胁时，你会立即感受到，就像我的学生在我假装爬向她照顾的孩子时所做的那样。

You won't need external warning systems or constant, paranoid vigilance. You'll automatically become alert to subtle violations, mushy agreements, unnecessary compromises, gaslighting, hidden sacrifices, invisible labor—all the crap that other people will throw at you that gets in the way of your desires, not to mention the crap you throw at yourself. No matter what they say, no matter how they try to persuade you that what you want isn't worth anything, or that you don't want what you want, your answer will be a quiet, immediate, don't-ask-again-or-I'll-rip-your-throat-out "Absolutely not."

你不需要外部警告系统或持续的、偏执的警惕。你会自动警觉到微妙的违规、模糊的协议、不必要的妥协、煤气灯效应、隐藏的牺牲、无形劳动——所有其他人会扔给你的阻碍你欲望的垃圾，更不用说你自己扔给自己的垃圾。无论他们说什么，无论他们如何试图说服你你想要的东西不值得任何东西，或者你不想要你想要的东西，你的答案将是一个安静的、立即的、不要再问否则我会撕开你喉咙的"绝对不行"。

That friend, always calling for advice that she never heeds, the one that keeps you on the phone for hours? If you're serious about writing that fantasy novel, saturated in your desire to do it, then you won't answer when her name lights up your phone during the three hours you've set aside to work on a Saturday afternoon. Feeling legitimate about your desire to work on your novel will fuel you not to answer.

那个总是打电话寻求建议但从不听从的朋友，那个让你在电话上聊几个小时的人？如果你认真地写那本奇幻小说，沉浸在你想做它的欲望中，那么当你在周六下午留出三个小时来工作时，当她的名字在你的手机上亮起时，你不会接电话。对你的小说工作欲望感到正当会激励你不接电话。

That's an easy one. But desire—and the Legitimacy exercise on the following pages—is also a tool you can use when the interruptions aren't so easy to pass up. For instance: What if someone offers you a contract to write a TV show? The money would be great, the showrunner is prestigious, and I don't need to tell you about the weather in L.A. But the commitment would be twenty-four/seven, and it would certainly take you away from that novel for a year, if not more.

这是一个简单的。但欲望——以及后面几页的正当性练习——也是你可以在干扰不容易放弃时使用的工具。例如：如果有人给你一份写电视节目的合同怎么办？钱会很棒，制片人很有声望，我不需要告诉你洛杉矶的天气。但承诺将是全天候的，它肯定会使你离开那本小说一年，如果不是更长时间的话。

What do you do then?

那你做什么？

You will have to spend some time with the question, allowing yourself to turn inward and really imagine, at the deepest level, what it would feel like to have both. And then ask yourself which of your choices—or one that's not even yet on the table!—would make you feel most alive, most unbound, most like your own creature.

你将不得不花一些时间思考这个问题，允许自己向内转，并真正想象，在最深的层面上，同时拥有两者会是什么感觉。然后问自己你的哪个选择——或者一个甚至还没有摆在桌面上的！——会让你感到最活着、最不受束缚、最像你自己的生物。

This is how the submissive superpower of plugging into our desires connects us to our truest destiny. Master legitimacy, and like a flower, you will know when you have turned your face toward the sun.

这就是顺从的超能力——连接到我们的欲望——如何将我们连接到我们最真实的命运。掌握正当性，就像一朵花，你会知道何时你已经将脸转向太阳。

#### EXERCISE | 练习

##### The Legitimacy Exercise | 正当性练习

This exercise strengthens your connection to your desires by creating a chamber for them.

这个练习通过为你的欲望创造一个空间来加强你与它们的连接。

To begin, locate something that you want, something you feel a little shaky about, something you don't quite feel like you deserve.

首先，定位一些你想要的东西，一些你感觉有点不确定的东西，一些你不太觉得自己应该拥有的东西。

Hold the desire in your mind. Imagine exactly what it would feel like to have this desire fulfilled.

在脑海中保持这个欲望。想象一下，如果这个欲望得到满足，会是什么感觉。

Close your eyes and imagine having it.

闭上眼睛，想象拥有它。

Now we're going to cycle through a few rounds of checking in with our physical sensations, our emotional reactions, and our thoughts.

现在我们将循环几轮，检查我们的身体感觉、情绪反应和想法。

First, note the physical sensations that arise when you imagine this desire satisfied. How does it feel? Are your cheeks flushing? Did your lungs contract or relax? What about your stomach? You will likely "feel" this desire in your body—in your heart area, the base of your belly, in your face. Place your hand or hands over that force field.

首先，注意当你想象这个欲望得到满足时出现的身体感觉。感觉如何？你的脸颊是否变红？你的肺部是收缩还是放松？你的胃呢？你可能在身体中"感觉"到这个欲望——在你的心脏区域，你的腹部底部，在你的脸上。把你的手或双手放在那个力场上。

Open your eyes, grab your notebook, and make a note of those sensations.

睁开眼睛，拿起你的笔记本，记录这些感觉。

Next, we'll move into the space of the emotions. Embody that space, where you already have whatever it is that you want. What comes up for you emotionally? Fear, sadness, anxiety, giddiness, excitement, expansion, pride, dread, validation, satisfaction?

接下来，我们将进入情绪的空间。体现那个空间，在那里你已经拥有你想要的一切。你在情绪上会出现什么？恐惧、悲伤、焦虑、眩晕、兴奋、扩展、骄傲、恐惧、验证、满足？

Open your eyes and write those emotions down.

睁开眼睛，写下那些情绪。

Next, we'll move into the mental sphere. What thoughts do you have, now that you've gotten this thing that you really, really want? What does having it prove about you? What new opportunities are available to you because you have it? What experiences will you now get to have that you couldn't have before? What will you get to see? What will your having it enable in the world? Who will you share it with? What will it enable you to become?

接下来，我们将进入心理领域。你有什么想法，既然你已经得到了你真正、真正想要的东西？拥有它证明了关于你的什么？因为你拥有它，你有哪些新的机会？你现在将获得哪些以前无法获得的经历？你将看到什么？你拥有它将在世界上实现什么？你会与谁分享它？它将使你成为什么？

Open your eyes and write those thoughts down.

睁开眼睛，写下那些想法。

We move through this cycle three times, experiencing a deepening each time. Every time we pass through, we get more clarity and specificity, and a closer alignment between the body, the emotional field, and the mind.

我们循环这个过程三次，每次体验加深。每次通过时，我们获得更多的清晰度和具体性，以及身体、情绪领域和思维之间更紧密的对齐。

All of the exercises in this book are designed so that you can return to them over and over, as your desires move and change. The Legitimacy exercise is one in particular that you can always count on, a safe place that you can return to whenever you begin to feel shame or greed or anxiety or uncertainty about wanting something. It is designed to help us check in with our minds, our hearts, our bodies, our souls, connecting to the deep legitimacy of what we want and need. Ultimately, we will learn to ask from this place—although once you've fully embraced this sweet surrendered state, you may find you don't need to ask at all.

这本书中的所有练习都是这样设计的，以便你可以一遍又一遍地回到它们，随着你的欲望移动和改变。正当性练习是一个你可以总是依赖的练习，一个安全的的地方，每当你想感到羞耻或贪婪或焦虑或对想要某物的不确定性时，你都可以回到这里。它旨在帮助我们检查我们的思维、我们的心、我们的身体、我们的灵魂，连接到我们想要和需要的深层正当性。最终，我们将学会从这个地方提问——虽然一旦你完全拥抱了这个甜蜜的投降状态，你可能会发现你根本不需要问。

For many of my students, this exercise is a lightbulb moment. But it can also give rise to some very uncomfortable sensations. When we imagine getting what we really, really want, a lot of stuff we don't want tends to rise up with it—like the fear of not getting it, of never having it, of getting it and not enjoying it, of it taking too much time or energy or money, of getting it and offending or alienating others, or causing us to be seen as breaking with or being disloyal to our families or community.

对我的许多学生来说，这个练习是一个顿悟时刻。但它也可能引起一些非常不舒服的感觉。当我们想象得到我们真正、真正想要的东西时，很多我们不想要的东西往往会随之而来——比如害怕得不到它，害怕永远无法拥有它，害怕得到它却不享受它，害怕它花费太多时间或精力或金钱，害怕得到它并冒犯或疏远他人，或导致我们被视为与我们的家庭或社区决裂或不忠。

What I'd encourage you to do, the next time you do the exercise, is to police the perimeter for those thoughts. Be vigilant; this exercise is the sacred vessel you are creating for your desire. Nothing else goes in there—not worry or other people's jealousy, or doubts about your own abilities, or fear.

我鼓励你下次做这个练习时要做的是，为那些想法警戒边界。保持警惕；这个练习是你为你的欲望创造的神圣容器。其他任何东西都不应该进入那里——不是担忧或他人的嫉妒，或对自己能力的怀疑，或恐惧。

And if a concern does sneak in, you have the power to neutralize it. Just as you can imagine what you want, you can imagine having it exactly the way you want it. You'd love a house on the water in Maine; then again, those types of houses tend to be old and cranky, and you have no idea how to deal with a septic tank. Don't let that stop you. Instead, imagine a legion of shirtless septic specialists on speed dial.

如果确实有一个担忧潜入，你有力量中和它。就像你可以想象你想要什么一样，你可以想象以你完全想要的方式拥有它。你想要缅因州水上的一所房子；再说一次，那些类型的房子往往是老旧和脾气暴躁的，你不知道如何处理化粪池。不要让那阻止你。相反，想象一支赤膊的化粪池专家队伍在快速拨号上。

want, we need to protect it from what you don't want.

想要，我们需要保护它免受你不想要的东西的影响。

There is another reason to keep this space pristine, and it's that this desire isn't likely to stay private—because you won't want it to! Once you feel its full power, you'll not only want to share it, but people will feel it, see it, and want to be a part of it. However, if you ask for what you want while you're still tapped into what you don't want, then your signal will not be clear to others. You will unwittingly transmit the bracing, the fear, the lack of legitimacy, and the uncertainty; these feelings will make your signal wobbly.

保持这个空间纯净还有另一个原因，那就是这个欲望不太可能保持私密——因为你不会希望它如此！一旦你感受到它的全部力量，你不仅会想要分享它，而且人们会感受到它，看到它，并想要成为它的一部分。然而，如果你在仍然连接到你不想要的东西时要求你想要的东西，那么你的信号对其他人来说将不清楚。你将无意中传递准备、恐惧、缺乏正当性和不确定性；这些感觉会使你的信号不稳定。

So for the span of this exercise the next time you do it, imagine that you already have the thing that you want. Not what it's going to cost you, not the consequences you will have to deal with if you get it, not the responsibilities that will come with it. Just close your eyes and imagine having it, exactly the way you want it.

所以下次你做这个练习时，想象你已经拥有你想要的东西。不是它将花费你什么，不是如果你得到它将不得不处理的后果，不是随之而来的责任。只需闭上眼睛，想象拥有它，完全按照你想要的方式。

The mental field, the emotional field, and the physical field are always at play, but they're not always in alignment or in agreement. This is a brand-new way of building a case—one that, crucially, includes the body in the creation of a new reality.

心理领域、情绪领域和身体领域总是在起作用，但它们并不总是在对齐或一致。这是一种全新的建立案例的方式——一种关键地，包括身体在创造新现实中的方式。

People often find themselves trapped in a loop: emotions to thoughts, thoughts to emotions. "I had a thought, and it made me scared, and that made me have another thought about being scared, which made me even more anxious." If that sounds familiar, it's because it's the structure of a shame spiral, or a panic attack.

人们经常发现自己被困在一个循环中：情绪到想法，想法到情绪。"我有一个想法，它让我害怕，这让我有另一个关于害怕的想法，这让我更加焦虑。"如果这听起来很熟悉，那是因为这是羞耻螺旋或恐慌发作的结构。

The way to break the circuit is to ground the sensation in the body, to feel the physical symptoms—pleasant or unpleasant—that arise when you think about having the thing you want.

打破电路的方法是将感觉锚定在身体中，感受当你想到拥有你想要的东西时出现的身体症状——愉快的或不愉快的。

We can't break through without bringing our bodies along.

我们不能在没有带着身体的情况下突破。

The Legitimacy exercise will enable you to locate and approve of your own truth, especially when tensions are high and it's not immediately clear. Practice this skill, and you'll find it's much easier to answer the questions "What do I want?" "How does this feel?" and "What's most alive for me, right now?"

正当性练习将使你能够定位和批准你自己的真相，特别是在紧张情绪高涨且并不立即清楚的时候。练习这个技能，你会发现回答"我想要什么？""这感觉如何？"和"现在对我来说最活着的是什么？"要容易得多。
