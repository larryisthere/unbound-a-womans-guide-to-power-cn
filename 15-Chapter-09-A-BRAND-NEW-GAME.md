#### EXERCISE | 练习

##### The Asking Practice | 要求练习

Take a piece of paper and write the following at the top:

拿一张纸，在顶部写下以下内容：

"I could ask ___________ for ___________."

"我可以向 ___________ 要求 ___________。"

We're going to start with men. Go through every single man you know, and think of something you could ask them for. There are no barriers to inclusion: any man you know personally is fine. (Why only men? Because if you train to do this with men, where the dynamics are so exaggerated, you'll see the subtler ones between women more clearly.)

我们将从男人开始。浏览你认识的每一个男人，想一些你可以向他们要求的东西。没有包含的障碍：你个人认识的任何男人都可以。（为什么只有男人？因为如果你训练与男人这样做，那里的动态是如此夸张，你会更清楚地看到女人之间更微妙的动态。）

You will not actually have to ask for these things, so explore the edges of your imagination. It's fine, too, to include items you aren't 100 percent sure you want.

你实际上不需要要求这些东西，所以探索你想象力的边缘。也可以包括你不100%确定想要的项目。

Write your list quickly and without thinking too hard, to increase the likelihood that you'll end up in unexpected territory. You're done when the list of men you can think of is done.

快速写下你的清单，不要太努力思考，以增加你最终进入意外领域的可能性。当你能想到的男人清单完成时，你就完成了。

One of the very first dungeons I worked at was gorgeously appointed. Every themed room (and there were many) was meticulously clean and impeccably equipped—but none of them made me swoon like the Throne Room.

我工作的最早的地牢之一被华丽地布置。每个主题房间（有很多）都精心清洁和装备完美——但没有一个像王座室那样让我着迷。

However, I learned that it was difficult to do an entire session seated, as you quickly run out of requests: there are only so many times a man can scrub a floor or kiss your feet. So I started to make lists—extensive, crazy lists—of things I could ask my clients to do while I was seated on that beautiful throne.

然而，我了解到很难整个会话都坐着完成，因为你很快就用完了要求：男人擦地板或亲吻你的脚只有这么多次。所以我开始列出清单——广泛的、疯狂的清单——列出我可以要求我的客户在我坐在那个美丽的王座上时做的事情。

I loved the project so much that I opened my personal address book one night, wondering what I could ask of my friends and relatives. Some of my Asks were "reasonable": Jeff could take me to meet the members of that band I liked; Safra could join me for a picnic and poetry in the park. But because this was all in the realm of my imagination, some of my Asks got pretty wild.

我非常喜欢这个项目，以至于一天晚上我打开了我的个人地址簿，想知道我可以向我的朋友和亲戚要求什么。我的一些要求是"合理的"：杰夫可以带我去见我喜欢的那个乐队的成员；萨夫拉可以和我一起去公园野餐和诗歌。但因为这一切都在我想象的领域内，我的一些要求变得相当狂野。

I had no idea that I had stumbled on a powerful healing tool with the Asking Practice until I began teaching; I simply loved the audacious feeling it gave me to become the creator of these adventures—and the clean, rut-busting light this simple imaginative exercise cast on desires I had pushed aside or forgotten about, or couldn't quite come out and own.

直到我开始教学，我才知道我偶然发现了一个强大的治疗工具——要求练习（Asking Practice）；我只是喜欢它给我的大胆感觉，成为这些冒险的创造者——以及这个简单的想象练习投射在我推在一旁或忘记的，或无法完全表达和拥有的欲望上的干净的、打破常规的光芒。

By making this a practice in my own life, I came to see how Asking liberated me from the curse of the Independent Woman: thinking that I had to do everything myself. It helped me to plumb my deepest desires. It elevated my relationships. It invited the people I knew to collaborate in my life in new and unforeseen ways, and allowed me to summon new people into my life, capable of meeting new needs as they arose. It was a way of following the life force, and tempting others to join me.

通过使这成为我生活中的一个实践，我开始看到要求如何将我从独立女性的诅咒中解放出来：认为我必须自己做所有事情。它帮助我探索我最深的欲望。它提升了我的关系。它邀请我认识的人以新的和意想不到的方式在我的生活中合作，并允许我召唤新的人进入我的生活，能够满足新出现的需求。这是一种跟随生命力的方式，并诱惑其他人加入我。

In short, Asking completely changed the landscape of my life, and theirs.

简而言之，要求完全改变了我生活的风景，以及他们的。

### A Thousand Sneaky Ways | 一千种狡猾的方式

Women often have a hard time asking, though, and part of that has to do with a misunderstanding of what it means to ask.

然而，女性往往很难要求，部分原因是误解了要求意味着什么。

Many of us were taught to think of asking as a gesture of last resort, one born of weakness, a sign that we're in need, or lesser than. Women's recent and hard-won independence means that for many of us, being in the position of supplicant feels humiliating, a confession of vulnerability akin to begging.

我们中的许多人被教导将要求视为最后的手段，一种源于软弱的手势，一种我们在需求中或低人一等的标志。女性最近来之不易的独立意味着对我们中的许多人来说，处于恳求者的位置感觉羞辱，一种类似于乞讨的脆弱表白。

Here are some common responses I hear as to why a woman's Asking Practice is blank:

以下是我听到的一些关于为什么女性的要求练习（Asking Practice）是空白的常见回应：

I can't think of any men I can ask to help. (See the box on this page.)

我想不出任何我可以要求帮助的男人。（见本页的框。）

I can't ask for something I can pay for myself.

我不能要求我可以自己付钱的东西。

I can't ask for something I could do myself but don't want to.

我不能要求我可以自己做但不想做的事情。

I can't ask if I haven't earned it.

如果我还没有赢得它，我不能要求。

I can't ask if the person isn't already in my debt.

如果这个人还没有欠我，我不能要求。

I can't ask if it means I'll owe him later.

如果这意味着我以后会欠他，我不能要求。

I can't ask unless I'm desperate.

除非我绝望，否则我不能要求。

I can't ask for something I want but don't really need.

我不能要求我想要但并不是真正需要的东西。

"But I don't know any men!"

"但我不认识任何男人！"

This is one of the excuses I hear most often in class, and I love to call it out when I hear it.

这是我在课堂上最常听到的借口之一，当我听到它时，我喜欢指出来。

In fact, about half the people you encounter on a daily basis are men, so: Do an Asking Practice on men you didn't initially consider. Who didn't you think of to ask? Professors from college? Exes? The chief medical officer at your company? The uncle who sends you really sad articles about animal rescues on Facebook? The bartender at the restaurant where you sometimes stop off for a glass of wine after work? The guy who parks your car? Your boss?

事实上，你每天遇到的人中约有一半是男人，所以：在你最初没有考虑的男人身上做要求练习（Asking Practice）。你没有想过要问谁？大学的教授？前任？你公司的首席医疗官？那个在Facebook上给你发送关于动物救援的非常悲伤文章的大叔？你有时下班后停下来喝一杯的餐厅的酒保？帮你停车的人？你的老板？

This is an exercise in imagination; you don't actually have to get in touch with any of these people, so cast your net widely: everyone is fair game! What I want you to see is the army you could command.

这是一个想象力的练习；你实际上不需要联系这些人中的任何一个，所以广泛撒网：每个人都是公平的游戏！我想让你看到的是你可以指挥的军队。

This resistance to asking is yet another manifestation of the Smush. Ask for help with something you don't want to do, and you're bossy. Ask for something you can't pay for, and you're pathetic, needy. Ask for something before you're desperate, and you're an entitled princess; wait until you really, really need it, and haven't you ever heard of planning? And who the hell do you think you are, to ask for something you haven't earned?

这种对要求的抵抗是挤压的另一种表现。要求帮助做你不想做的事情，你是专横的。要求你付不起的东西，你是可悲的、需要的。在你绝望之前要求某物，你是一个被宠坏的公主；等到你真的、真的需要它，你没听说过计划吗？你认为你是谁，要求你没有赢得的东西？

Better, then, not to ask at all, but to shut up and pull a solo mission: Independent Woman to the rescue, again.

那么，最好不要问，而是闭嘴并执行一个单独的任务：独立女性再次拯救。

Women often hesitate to ask because they have been trained to believe that asking will create an implied debt, a bill that too often feels like it's going to come due in the form of the reluctant exchange of sexual favors. There's a confession along these lines in every single class I've ever taught: "I felt like I should have sex with him, because he came over and helped me put up a shelf." Or a recent one that broke my heart: a woman who didn't eat on a two-day-long trip with her lecherous boss because she believed that consuming food he'd paid for would give him the tacit yes he'd been looking for.

女性经常犹豫不决，因为她们被训练相信要求会创造一种隐含的债务，一张账单，经常感觉它会以不情愿的性恩惠交换的形式到期。在我教过的每一堂课中，都有这样的告白："我觉得我应该和他上床，因为他过来帮我安装了一个架子。"或者最近一个让我心碎的：一个在她好色的老板的两天长途旅行中不吃饭的女人，因为她相信消费他付钱的食物会给他他一直在寻找的默认同意。

These women aren't crazy; in many cases, there is an assumed sexual quid pro quo when a guy shows up at your house with his drill. But the solution cannot be to do everything ourselves, or to starve on a two-day work trip. The first step is to establish what's going on—whether you're dealing with someone who expects you to trade sex (or anything else) for handyman duties, or whether this is your assumption about what he expects. A tool called "location," which you've already learned to use on yourself and will find more about using with others in chapter 14, will help you to cut through the fog of ambiguity. Of course, it's much easier to embark on that quest with confidence when you know you can handle whatever might come next.

这些女人并不疯狂；在很多情况下，当一个男人带着他的钻头出现在你家时，会有一个假定的性交换。但解决方案不能是我们自己做所有事情，或者在两天的出差中挨饿。第一步是确定正在发生什么——你是在与一个期望你以性（或任何其他东西）交换手工职责的人打交道，还是这是你对他的期望的假设。一个叫做"定位"的工具，你已经学会在自己身上使用，并将在第14章中找到更多关于与他人使用的信息，将帮助你穿透模糊的迷雾。当然，当你知道你可以处理接下来可能发生的任何事情时，更自信地开始这个追求会容易得多。

Even more women don't ask because they're deathly afraid of hearing no. This one is so pervasive, and such a missed opportunity, that I've dedicated the whole next chapter to it. Suffice to say: Once you can confidently keep your attention out on the other person, the word "no" is simply a doorway to the good stuff. Just as your own resistance is how you are protecting the most important parts of yourself, so is resistance in another person merely their attempt to keep an important part of themselves safe. Their resistance, then, is an opportunity for intimacy that yes can never be: it is your chance to learn something really important about the other person's world, and what they have to offer.

更多的女性不问是因为她们非常害怕听到"不"。这个问题如此普遍，如此错失的机会，以至于我专门写了整整下一章。只需说：一旦你能自信地将注意力保持在另一个人身上，"不"这个词只是通向好东西的门。正如你自己的抵抗是你保护自己最重要的部分的方式一样，另一个人的抵抗只是他们试图保护自己重要部分安全的尝试。那么，他们的抵抗是一个亲密的机会，"是"永远不可能是：这是你了解另一个人的世界和他们必须提供的东西的机会。

But because there are such strong prohibitions against asking, women have devised a thousand sneaky ways to ask without asking. We've already talked, for instance, about how women tend to complain instead of asking. We also tend to hint at what we would like instead of asking directly for it. Instead of saying, "Close the window?" we say, "Oooh. It's a little chilly today, no?" Other women read these implied Asks and respond to them: "You're right! Let me shut this window." Men tend to need a more direct Ask, though, which often leads to frustration on both sides: you asked him to close the damn window, didn't you? Except that you didn't.

但由于有如此强烈的禁止要求的禁令，女性已经设计了一千种狡猾的方式来要求而不要求。例如，我们已经讨论过女性如何倾向于抱怨而不是要求。我们也倾向于暗示我们想要的，而不是直接要求它。不是说"关窗？"我们说："哦。今天有点冷，不是吗？"其他女性阅读这些隐含的要求并回应它们："你说得对！让我关上这扇窗。"然而，男人往往需要更直接的要求，这往往导致双方都感到沮丧：你让他关上该死的窗户，不是吗？除了你没有。

In a similar vein,

同样地，

women often substitute reciprocity for asking.

女性经常用互惠代替要求。

Instead of making a request, we give what we want to get. (So many blow jobs!) Unfortunately, reciprocity isn't like gravity—there's no universal law. In fact, this assumption is based on a false premise: people tend not to create mirror roles, but complementary ones.

不是提出要求，我们给出我们想要得到的东西。（这么多口交！）不幸的是，互惠不像重力——没有普遍规律。事实上，这个假设基于一个错误的前提：人们往往不创造镜像角色，而是互补的角色。

This reciprocity trap is a particularly dangerous one, because it creates an invisible balance sheet, where the man is failing to perform tasks he doesn't even realize he's been assigned. You do it all, but he doesn't mirror you—so not only do you not get what you want, but you've further entangled the two of you in a dynamic of failure and disappointment.

这个互惠陷阱是一个特别危险的陷阱，因为它创造了一个无形的资产负债表，在这个资产负债表中，男人未能执行他甚至没有意识到的任务。你做了一切，但他不模仿你——所以你不仅得不到你想要的，而且你进一步将你们两个纠缠在失败和失望的动态中。

The result, then, from these non-asking Asks is that we don't get what we want—or not exactly, anyway. As we will see, that's a tiny price compared to all the other riches that are lost when we don't ask. But before we get to that, let's reshape what you think of when you think of an Ask.

那么，这些不要求的要求的结果是我们没有得到我们想要的——或者无论如何不是完全如此。正如我们将看到的，与我们不要求时失去的所有其他财富相比，这是一个很小的代价。但在我们到达那里之前，让我们重塑当你想到一个要求时你想到的。

### Redefining Asking | 重新定义要求

Nearly every social interaction already contains an Ask.

几乎每一个社交互动都包含一个要求。

When a stranger gets on the elevator and says, "Wow, it's a scorcher out there!" she is making a request. We don't know yet the desire behind it—whether it's a bid for attention, connection, or simply a social grace note, intended to make everyday intra-elevator awkwardness a little less acute. But it is a request.

当一个陌生人上电梯说："哇，外面真热！"她正在提出一个请求。我们还不知道背后的欲望——无论是为了引起注意、连接，还是只是一个社交礼貌的笔记，旨在使日常电梯内的尴尬减少一点。但它是一个请求。

This is true of most of our interactions: we're all asking for things all the time, often without explicitly stating our opinions and desires. We set expectations, make requests, and issue invitations every time we make contact with other humans, even when we aren't using words. And we are training the people we interact with how to behave around us all the time, through our language and behavior, whether we're aware of it or not. (The simplest example: if you never pick up your phone before noon, the people in your life will eventually stop calling you in the morning.)

我们的大多数互动都是如此：我们一直在要求东西，通常没有明确表达我们的意见和欲望。每次我们与他人接触时，我们都会设定期望、提出请求和发出邀请，即使我们没有使用词语。我们正在训练我们互动的人如何在我们周围表现，通过我们的语言和行为，无论我们是否意识到这一点。（最简单的例子：如果你在中午之前从不接电话，你生活中的人最终会停止在早上给你打电话。）

Asking simply takes all those hidden requests and cues and makes them explicit by putting them into language. Asking makes these interactions visible and allows you to be deliberate about them, so you deploy them with awareness.

要求只是将所有那些隐藏的请求和线索提取出来，通过将它们放入语言来使其明确。要求使这些互动可见，并允许你有意地使用它们，所以你以意识部署它们。

For women not to ask is a terrible loss. I understand that it can be frightening for those of us who pride ourselves on our independence to realize that bringing a dream into the real world may require the assistance, help, support, and collaboration of others.

对女性来说不要求是一个可怕的损失。我理解，对我们这些以独立为荣的人来说，意识到将梦想带入现实世界可能需要其他人的协助、帮助、支持和合作，这可能令人恐惧。

But when we look at men who are succeeding, we see that they are asking for and receiving help all of the time, although many of those Asks are camouflaged as commands or factual statements: "You're going to pick up the dry cleaning after work, right?" and "After you've picked up the dry cleaning, text me to let me know they got that stain out." This is not to mention the ten thousand invisible structures set up to facilitate men's movement through the world.

但当我们看成功的男人时，我们看到他们一直在要求并获得帮助，尽管许多这些要求被伪装成命令或事实陈述："你下班后会去取干洗的衣服，对吧？"和"你取完干洗的衣服后，发短信告诉我他们去掉了那个污渍。"这还不包括为促进男人在世界中移动而设立的无数无形结构。

The idea that we can do anything truly meaningful alone is a misconception, and a dangerous one.

我们可以独自做任何真正有意义的事情的想法是一个误解，而且是一个危险的误解。

Nothing meaningful is built without collaboration, and no collaboration exists without conversations, arguments, and agreements.

没有合作就建不成有意义的东西，没有对话、争论和协议就不存在合作。

Any time we wish to create something bold and new in our lives, we need to enlist allies.

任何时候我们希望在生活中创造一些大胆和新的东西，我们需要招募盟友。

An Ask can be a confession of a desire, and a first step toward seeing it satisfied. It can be an invitation into your inner world, and a means of making space for someone else to join you there. It can be an expression of agency, a confirmation of alliances, the transformation of a dynamic. It can be the instigation for a game, a new conversation, or a different way to play.

一个要求可以是欲望的告白，以及朝着看到它得到满足的第一步。它可以是对你内心世界的邀请，以及为其他人加入你创造空间的手段。它可以是一种能动性的表达，对联盟的确认，动态的转变。它可以是一个游戏、一个新对话或不同游戏方式的激发。

### Asking Creates Roles | 要求创造角色

Women are taught early that asking creates debt, that it automatically leads to quid pro quo. Ask someone for a favor, and you'll owe them—of course you do, because giving depletes them.

女性很早就被教导要求会创造债务，它会自动导致交换。向某人要求恩惠，你会欠他们——当然你会的，因为给予会消耗他们。

That's just wrong.

这只是错的。

Asking doesn't take away from the people you ask; instead, it creates new and exciting roles for them.

要求不会从你提问的人那里夺走；相反，它为他们创造新的和令人兴奋的角色。

When my friend Jeremy worked as a substitute teacher, his tried-and-true method for gaining control of a new classroom was to quickly identify the saboteur (the "bad kid")—and then assign that kid the most serious responsibility in the classroom: "Will you take attendance, and then take the roll book down to the principal's office?"

当我朋友杰里米担任代课老师时，他获得新教室控制权的可靠方法是快速识别破坏者（"坏孩子"）——然后给那个孩子分配教室里最严肃的责任："你能点名，然后把点名册送到校长办公室吗？"

It worked every time. The kid's back would straighten as he called out the names; afterward, he'd carry the book down the stairs like it was a holy scroll. He was already trying to be in charge of the classroom! Jeremy simply put his desire to work, transforming his role—from troublemaker to trusted teacher's assistant—with an Ask.

每次都很有效。孩子叫名字时会挺直背；之后，他会像拿着圣卷一样把书带下楼。他已经在试图负责教室了！杰里米只是把他的工作欲望付诸实践，通过一个要求转变他的角色——从麻烦制造者到值得信赖的老师助手。

Asking raises people up and creates unprecedented opportunities for cooperation and engagement. We don't always realize how much control we have over the way people show up in our lives, and who they show up as. An Ask is the conscious creation of a role for a person in your life—and the role you create for them can be a parasite or a monster, a knight in shining armor, a nurturing mother goddess, or a mentor.

要求提升人们，并为合作和参与创造前所未有的机会。我们并不总是意识到我们对人们在我们生活中出现的方式以及他们以谁的身份出现有多少控制。一个要求是为一个人在你的生活中创造角色的有意识创造——你为他们创造的角色可以是寄生虫或怪物，闪亮盔甲的骑士，养育的母亲女神，或导师。

Asking is how we expand people's functions in our lives; it is how we solicit them to move into new ones that are better for both parties.

要求是我们如何在生活中扩展人们的功能；这是我们如何请求他们进入对双方都更好的新角色。

Every time you ask someone for something, you are offering them a role in your life. So instead of a lengthy negotiation, why not just decide what role you want the other person to play, and then ask them to step into it?

每次你向某人要求某物时，你都在为他们提供你生活中的一个角色。那么，与其进行冗长的谈判，为什么不直接决定你想要另一个人扮演什么角色，然后要求他们进入这个角色？

Who are you going to invite to be your partner in crime? Who's going to teach you about wealth, about fame, about how to conduct a legendary love affair? The brother who's been picking on you since you were five is the absolute best mock opponent to prepare you for a tough negotiation; if you let him take the gloves off, there's no way a hostile co-op board will catch you unprepared.

你打算邀请谁成为你的犯罪伙伴？谁将教你财富、名望，以及如何进行传奇般的恋爱？那个从你五岁起就一直欺负你的兄弟是为艰难谈判准备你的绝对最佳模拟对手；如果你让他脱下手套，一个敌对的合作公寓董事会不可能抓住你毫无准备。

My student Julia, an impoverished artist who was gifted a class at The Academy, went on to earn seven (!) figures from her paintings that summer. She's currently in contract for a property in Vermont that she's planning to turn into a retreat center for others—because the Ask she made transformed an estranged uncle, a man without a clean role in her life or her family, into a noble benefactor of the arts and a treasured mentor.

我的学生朱莉娅，一个被赠送了学院课程的贫困艺术家，那年夏天继续从她的画作中赚取了七位数（！）。她目前在佛蒙特州签订了一份财产合同，计划将其变成其他人的静修中心——因为她提出的要求将一位疏远的叔叔，一个在她生活或家庭中没有清晰角色的男人，转变成了艺术的高贵捐助者和珍贵的导师。

Using Asking as a way to invite someone into a new role is especially valuable in long-term relationships, particularly ones where the dynamic has gotten stale. The right Ask can get the energy moving again.

使用要求作为邀请某人进入新角色的方式在长期关系中特别有价值，特别是在动态已经变得陈旧的长期关系中。正确的要求可以让能量再次流动。

When my student Glyn and her husband were getting a divorce, she insisted on splitting everything in half. It was so fair! And yet everyone was miserable—by the time I was talking to her, mediation had completely stalled.

当我的学生格琳和她的丈夫离婚时，她坚持把一切分成两半。太公平了！然而每个人都很痛苦——到我与她谈话时，调解已经完全停滞。

I didn't think the stall had come despite the equitable split—I thought it was because of it. Unlike Glyn, I do not necessarily buy into Good Girl expectations of reciprocity. After a quick conversation with the two of them, it was clear to me that by insisting on parity, Glyn had robbed her husband of any role that might allow him to feel okay about their split.

我不认为停滞是因为公平分割而来——我认为它是因为公平分割。与格琳不同，我不一定接受好女孩对互惠的期望。在与他们两人快速交谈后，我清楚地看到，通过坚持平等，格琳剥夺了她丈夫任何可能让他对他们的分割感觉良好的角色。

I advised her to pay for more of something else if she felt so passionate about an equal division, but suggested that she assign her soon-to-be-ex husband financial responsibility for all of their daughter's education. Glyn did make him the master of that realm, the negotiations proceeded, and her ex gratefully stepped into the role of Great Dad. He still takes a good deal of pride in that role.

我建议她如果对平等分割如此热衷，就为其他事情支付更多，但建议她分配即将成为前夫的男人对她们女儿所有教育的财务责任。格琳确实让他成为那个领域的掌控者，谈判继续进行，她的前夫感激地进入了伟大父亲的角色。他仍然为这个角色感到非常自豪。

Which of your friends has a genius for costume design? Is there an Ask you could make of her that would turn her from someone who complains endlessly about her boyfriend into a fun fairy godmother who comes over to completely reimagine your wardrobe, and your identity along with it?

你的哪个朋友有服装设计的天赋？你能向她提出一个要求，将她从无休止地抱怨男朋友的人转变为一个有趣的仙女教母，她过来完全重新想象你的衣橱，以及你的身份？

When a relationship is stuck, the first thing I do is look for what the unmet energetic needs are; every relationship has them. Then it's time to figure out if there's an Ask that will answer them.

当一段关系陷入困境时，我做的第一件事是寻找未满足的能量需求是什么；每段关系都有它们。然后是该弄清楚是否有一个要求可以回答它们。

A long-married couple came to see me, bored and dissatisfied. The wife told me she wanted to see other people, so she first asked for one-way monogamy. After a few months, her husband agreed, and although she didn't actually end up seeing anyone else, just that Ask was enough to improve relations between them—so much so that, a few months in, she told him she wanted him to be able to see other people, too.

一对长期结婚的夫妇来找我，感到无聊和不满意。妻子告诉我她想见其他人，所以她首先要求单方面一夫一妻制。几个月后，她的丈夫同意了，虽然她实际上最终没有见其他人，但仅仅是那个要求就足以改善他们之间的关系——以至于几个月后，她告诉他她也希望他能够见其他人。

Neither of them ended up sleeping with anyone outside the marriage, but the Asks allowed them to admit that they're sometimes attracted to other people, and helped them to see each other as free agents again. Update: They're currently fucking like rabbits. They gave each other freedom, only to realize that they wanted each other.

他们两人最终都没有与婚姻外的人睡觉，但这些要求允许他们承认他们有时被其他人吸引，并帮助他们再次将彼此视为自由代理人。更新：他们目前像兔子一样做爱。他们给了彼此自由，只是为了意识到他们想要彼此。

Unmet energetic needs can be emotional withholds, or a lack of clarity around finances, or around sex. It could be something you're not saying—something you feel that you've sacrificed or need credit for. (I sometimes joke that we could call this book Things Unsaid, present that single exercise, and call it a day.) And the Asks that satisfy these might be deeply unconventional, seem silly or strange—but they are correct.

未满足的能量需求可能是情感上的保留，或者是对财务或性缺乏清晰度。可能是你没有说的事情——你感到你已经牺牲或需要认可的事情。（我有时开玩笑说，我们可以把这本书称为"未曾言说之事"，展示那个单一的练习，然后收工。）满足这些的要求可能非常不传统，看起来很愚蠢或奇怪——但它们是正确的。

Every complaint hides a desire.

每个抱怨都隐藏着一个欲望。

Use your desires as your compass. Interrogate your complaints. Chase those vague impulses. Think about what the Ask might be that would change the landscape. Before you ask, turn it around so you know what role you are inviting the other person into.

用你的欲望作为你的指南针。质疑你的抱怨。追逐那些模糊的冲动。想想可能是怎样的要求会改变风景。在你提问之前，把它转过来，这样你就知道你在邀请另一个人进入什么角色。

This is how you create an intentional community of people who are supporting you. The right Ask can transform a relationship. Once you've asked someone to invest in you and they have seen the results, they want to do it again. When you let someone contribute to you in a new way, they become part of your life in a new way. More often than not, once they've had the pleasure of supporting you or collaborating with you, or simply being party to your joy, they start looking for other ways to make that happen.

这就是你如何创建一个有意支持你的人的社区。正确的要求可以改变一段关系。一旦你要求某人投资你，他们看到了结果，他们就想再次这样做。当你让某人以新方式为你做出贡献时，他们以新方式成为你生活的一部分。通常情况下，一旦他们享受了支持你或与你合作的快乐，或者只是参与你的快乐，他们就开始寻找其他方法来实现这一点。

### The Cost of Not Asking | 不要求的代价

The women I work with hear things like "Thank you for choosing me." "Thank you for thinking of me when you needed something." They're thanking you for allowing them to show up in a new role in your life, a better one—a role that's closer to the person they want to be.

与我一起工作的女性听到诸如"谢谢你选择我"和"谢谢你在需要什么时想到我"这样的话。他们感谢你允许他们在你的生活中扮演新角色，一个更好的角色——一个更接近他们想要成为的人的角色。

This is why the cost of asking too little or not asking at all is higher than you think.

这就是为什么要求太少或完全不要求的代价比你想象的要高。

Many women pride themselves on being low-maintenance. Either there's nothing in the world a woman needs from the people in her life: "I've got this." Or she gets mad that nobody has read her mind about what she wants, so she goes ahead and does it for herself. The message the people in her life get, over time, is that they might as well not even try.

许多女性以低维护而自豪。要么世界上一个女人不需要从她生活中的人那里得到任何东西："我能搞定。"要么她生气没有人读懂她想要什么，所以她继续为自己做。她生活中的人得到的消息，随着时间的推移，是他们不妨不尝试。

How many kickass women do you know who have over-supported and over-given to their men, and by doing so have made him useless in her own eyes? This is how we train men to be losers in our lives: We never let them shine. We put them in our debt and never let them get out of it. And when we start to feel bitter about the fact that they're such losers, we comfort ourselves by feeling morally superior.

你认识多少强大的女性，她们过度支持和过度给予他们的男人，这样做使他看起来无用？这就是我们如何训练男人在我们生活中成为失败者：我们从不让他们发光。我们让他们欠债，从不让他们摆脱。当我们开始对他们是如此失败者感到苦涩时，我们通过感到道德优越来安慰自己。

A woman prides herself on never asking, not needing anything—and then she's surprised when her spouse leaves her for someone that he can provide for and impress. "Of course, the other woman is always younger," they say—but in most of the cases I've seen, the new relationship is one in which the man finally has an opportunity to show his agency, to feel used and needed in all the best ways.

一个女人以从不要求、不需要任何东西而自豪——然后当她的配偶离开她去找一个他可以提供和打动的人时，她感到惊讶。"当然，另一个女人总是更年轻，"他们说——但在我看到的大多数情况下，新关系是男人终于有机会展示他的能动性，以所有最好的方式感到被使用和需要。

Every time you ask someone for something, you are offering them a role in your life. Asking someone for less means offering them a lesser role.

每次你向某人要求某物时，你都在为他们提供你生活中的一个角色。向某人要求更少意味着为他们提供更小的角色。

I'm not blaming here, please understand—this self-fulfilling prophecy is all part of Good Girl conditioning, and it's a great example of why this particular set of conditions sucks for men, too.

我在这里不责怪，请理解——这个自我实现的预言都是好女孩条件反射的一部分，这是为什么这组特定条件对男人也很糟糕的一个很好的例子。

What if we reassured the men in our lives that we wouldn't let them be losers when it came to bringing us joy? What if we told them that we would never let them fail us, without providing a subsequent opportunity for success? What if we gave them ample, abundant opportunities to get it right, and rewarded them when they did? What if we were to shine a bright light on our desires, so that it became an orientation point for them, a compass heading, their True North?

如果我们向生活中的男人保证，在给我们带来快乐时，我们不会让他们成为失败者呢？如果我们告诉他们我们永远不会让他们失败我们，而不提供随后的成功机会呢？如果我们给他们充足、丰富的机会来做好，并在他们做对时奖励他们呢？如果我们把明亮的光照在我们的欲望上，这样它就成为他们的方向点、指南针方向、他们的真北呢？

Make no mistake: this is very different from the ways that Good Girls are trained to "take care" of their men. In fact, empowering the people in your life this way is a step toward unraveling that conditioning.

不要搞错：这与好女孩被训练"照顾"她们男人的方式非常不同。事实上，以这种方式赋予你生活中的人权力是解开那种条件反射的一步。

I don't want you to become less of a phenomenally loving person, but more of one. Love is anything that moves people toward truth and growth, and the Good Girl is really, really bad at that. Instead, she protects, gives false compliments, withholds essential information, and offers silence when she should be delivering truth.

我不希望你成为一个不那么异常有爱心的人，而是成为一个更有爱心的人。爱是任何让人们走向真理和成长的东西，而好女孩真的非常不擅长这一点。相反，她保护，给予虚假的赞美，隐瞒重要信息，并在应该传递真相时提供沉默。

Stop briefly to consider all the dangers that come along with the "Well, the captain's been drinking, but everything's fine" paradigm.

停下来简要考虑与"好吧，船长一直在喝酒，但一切都很好"范式一起出现的所有危险。

It might be easier to look at this behavior in someone's else life. I'd wager that you know a woman whose relationship is characterized by withheld information—things not said. This woman specializes in secret sacrifices, everything she's given up that has gone unacknowledged by her partner. Not that she brought his attention to those sacrifices, of course—how then would she be able to hold his not-noticing against him?

在别人的生活中看这种行为可能更容易。我敢打赌你认识一个关系以隐瞒信息为特征的女人——没有说的事情。这个女人专门从事秘密牺牲，她放弃的一切都没有得到她的伴侣的认可。当然，她没有引起他对那些牺牲的注意——那么她怎么能用他的不注意来对付他呢？

She uses her martyrdom in the name of tyranny. She bludgeons him with his own ignorance and confusion, using her own dissatisfaction as a tool for control. "You're doing it wrong," she tells him, but she never tells him how to do it right, so he retreats and does less, while she gets angrier and angrier. She'll go so far as to go without in order to deny him a win, hiding her pleasure so deep he'll never find it, and she'll never stop castigating him for his failure.

她以暴政的名义使用她的殉道。她用他自己的无知和困惑来攻击他，用自己的不满作为控制的工具。"你做错了，"她告诉他，但她从未告诉他如何做对，所以他退缩并做得更少，而她越来越生气。她会走得很远以至于放弃，以拒绝他的胜利，把她的快乐藏得如此深，他永远不会找到它，她永远不会停止因他的失败而谴责他。

This ugly outcome, my friends—this truly advanced-level rage—is what happens when you don't ask, when you don't tell him how you like it, when you don't say what's true for you. And doing so—skillfully, creatively—is the only way out of that hellscape.

这个丑陋的结果，我的朋友们——这种真正高级的愤怒——发生在你不问、不告诉他你喜欢什么、不说对你是真实的时候。这样做——巧妙地、创造性地——是走出那个地狱的唯一方法。

There is no such thing as a low-maintenance woman. There is no such thing as a low-maintenance person. Buying into this myth means leaving a lot of opportunity on the table. Power is not something one experiences in isolation: you do not sit in a room quietly and empower yourself. Power is a function of strong relationships, where what you receive from the people in your life is exactly what you need and want, and where what you give is valued by the receiver.

没有低维护的女性这样的事。没有低维护的人这样的事。相信这个神话意味着在桌子上留下很多机会。权力不是一个人孤立体验的东西：你不会安静地坐在房间里并赋予自己权力。权力是强大关系的功能，你从生活中的人那里收到的正是你需要和想要的，而你给予的是被接收者重视的。

So the next time you think, "I don't need to ask him for that," or deny your own desires by saying, "I'm okay; I don't need that at all," I'd like you to remember this: Every time you don't ask someone, you are depriving them of the opportunity to play a specific role that the profound intelligence of your deep desire is trying to call forth.

所以下次你想"我不需要向他要求那个"或通过说"我很好；我根本不需要那个"来否认你自己的欲望时，我希望你记住这一点：每次你不问某人，你都在剥夺他们扮演一个特定角色的机会，这个角色是你深层欲望的深刻智慧试图召唤的。

### The Making of the "We" | "我们"的创造

It's no secret that we live in one of the most isolated times in human history. Despite all of our virtual connectedness, the consensus is that we have many fewer close friends and people we can rely on.

众所周知，我们生活在人类历史上最孤立的时代之一。尽管我们所有的虚拟连接，共识是我们拥有更少的亲密朋友和我们能够依赖的人。

Add Good Girl conditioning and the bittersweet victory of the Independent Woman, and you see how isolated women can become in this insular society—and how we end up connecting only through what we can offer, how we measure up.

加上好女孩条件反射和独立女性的苦乐参半的胜利，你看到女性在这个孤岛社会中会变得多么孤立——以及我们如何最终只通过我们能提供什么、我们如何衡量来连接。

When you are content to settle for only the crumbs that fall off the table, you insulate yourself unnecessarily, walling yourself off from an entire realm of collaboration, adventure, and magic. More than that, you cede your rightful position as active creator of your life; you relinquish the steering wheel and put yourself in the passenger seat with your desires locked in the trunk.

当你满足于只接受从桌子上掉下的面包屑时，你不必要地孤立自己，将自己与整个合作、冒险和魔法的领域隔离开来。更重要的是，你放弃了你作为生活积极创造者的正当地位；你放弃方向盘，把自己放在乘客座位上，你的欲望锁在后备箱里。

Asking is a revolutionary act against the isolation of the current age, and the blow that breaks the chains of the compression wrought by thousands of years of conditioning, leaving us free to connect and gather in communities where we can create things that no one person could do alone.

要求是对当前时代孤立的革命性行为，是打破由数千年条件反射造成的压迫链条的打击，让我们自由地在社区中连接和聚集，在那里我们可以创造任何一个人都无法独自完成的事情。

This is why I want you to feel not just good but fantastic about asking. If desires are a message from you to you about what makes you feel most alive, then an Ask is an extended hand, a way of inviting other people to participate in that part of you. If what they bring is the part of them that is most alive, then every link is powerful, and you are looking at the beginning of a truly transformative community.

这就是为什么我希望你对要求感到不仅好而且很棒。如果欲望是你对自己关于什么让你感觉最活着的消息，那么一个要求是伸出的手，一种邀请其他人参与你那部分的方式。如果他们带来的是他们最活着的部分，那么每个链接都是强大的，你正在看到一个真正变革性社区的开始。

Alia was one of my students, facing down one of the most unpleasant tasks that comes up when a marriage is over: she and her soon-to-be ex had to split up their possessions and sell the house they'd lived in together.

女主人阿莉娅（Mistress Alia）是我的一个学生，面对婚姻结束时出现的最不愉快的任务之一：她和即将成为前夫的人必须分割他们的财产并出售他们一起住的房子。

The heavy emotional weight of what she needed to do—sorting through everything in the house; figuring out what to keep, what to sell, and what to store; and then getting rid of everything else, cleaning the house, putting it on the market, showing it, negotiating the deal—was really bogging Alia down, so much so that she'd stopped being able to do the exercises in class. What she was facing was a huge amount of work, fraught with all her grief and guilt and disappointment about the end of the marriage.

她需要做的沉重的情绪负担——整理房子里的一切；弄清楚要保留什么、要出售什么、要存储什么；然后处理其他一切，清洁房子，将其上市，展示它，谈判交易——真的把阿莉娅压垮了，以至于她停止了在课堂上做练习。她面对的是大量工作，充满了她所有的悲伤、内疚和对婚姻结束的失望。

My first question: "Why does it fall to you to do this, and not him?" Hello, invisible labor!

我的第一个问题："为什么这落在你身上，而不是他？"你好，无形劳动！

"I never really thought about that—I guess I do care more about some of the stuff in the house than he does."

"我从来没有真正想过这个问题——我想我确实比他对房子里的一些东西更关心。"

"Great!" I said. "What if you just went and took the things that you like?"

"太好了！"我说。"如果你只是去拿你喜欢的东西呢？"

"I'd still have to figure out what to trash and what to sell. God, I wish I could hire someone to break in and steal the items I want to keep."

"我仍然必须弄清楚要扔掉什么和要出售什么。天哪，我希望我能雇人闯入并偷走我想保留的物品。"

Which made me jump up and down with excitement. "I love this idea! This is what you're going to do! You're going to burgle your own house! Who's going to come with you, to help carry all your loot?"

这让我兴奋得跳来跳去。"我喜欢这个想法！这就是你要做的！你要闯入你自己的房子！谁会和你一起来，帮你携带所有的战利品？"

She named five or six women, at least three of whom were in the room. One of them, hearing the plan, hollered: "Yeah! We'll dress up like pirates!" Another one, wanting to play, offered her spacious living room as the ideal place for the pirates to sort their booty into piles of keep, sell, and store. Another one offered to bring the champagne.

她列出了五六个女人，至少三个在房间里。其中一个听到这个计划，大声喊道："是的！我们会打扮成海盗！"另一个想要玩，提供她宽敞的客厅作为海盗将战利品分类成保留、出售和存储的理想场所。另一个提议带香槟。

"If you could ask for anything to happen here, what would that Ask be?"

"如果你能要求这里发生任何事情，那个要求会是什么？"

"I'd ask if I could go in and take the things I want, leaving everything else for him to deal with—including the sale of the house."

"我会问如果我能否进去拿走我想要的东西，把其他一切都留给他处理——包括房子的出售。"

"Text him and find out," I said.

"给他发短信，找出答案，"我说。

Alia was shocked by her ex's response, which came immediately: "Sure. Sounds good." A solid month of hard, horrible work—poof! Gone. Just because she asked.

阿莉娅对她前夫立即回复感到震惊："当然。听起来不错。"整整一个月的艰难、可怕的工作——噗！消失了。仅仅因为她问了。

Meanwhile, her other Ask—for some Mistress support at her looting party—was also making magic. Alia could certainly have gotten a friend to dutifully accompany her on this loathsome errand; it was just so hard and heavy that she didn't want to ask anybody. But as soon as it turned into a pirate party, she could have sold tickets. Isn't an unpleasant, heavy task like divvying up the family photo albums a little bit more fun if you're wearing bandannas and eye patches and hollering, "Avast, ye scurvy dogs!"?

同时，她的另一个要求——在她的掠夺派对上得到一些女主人（Mistress）支持——也在创造魔法。阿莉娅当然可以让一个朋友尽职地陪伴她完成这个令人讨厌的任务；只是如此艰难和沉重，以至于她不想问任何人。但一旦它变成海盗派对，她本可以卖票。如果你戴着头巾和眼罩并大声喊道："停住，你们这些坏蛋！"，像分割家庭相册这样不愉快、沉重的任务不是更有趣吗？

This is emotional alchemy. This is turning a complaint into a desire. It's also an Outrageous Ask. This is how you create roles that not only transform relationships but create communities and transform reality.

这是情感炼金术。这是将抱怨转化为欲望。这也是一个离谱的要求。这就是你如何创造不仅改变关系而且创造社区并改变现实的角色。

After the pirate party, which by all accounts was a complete blast, her ex never went back to the house. He hired a specialist to get rid of the furniture that was left, a hauler to pick up the junk; the broker handled the rest. (Note how easily he sidestepped all that difficult emotional and physical labor!)

在海盗派对之后，据所有人说这是一个完全爆炸的活动，她的前夫再也没有回到房子。他雇了一个专家来处理留下的家具，一个搬运工来捡垃圾；经纪人处理了其余的事情。（注意他是多么容易地回避了所有那些困难的情绪和体力劳动！）

And Alia never had to do a thing she didn't want to do.

而阿莉娅永远不必做她不想做的事。

Not only did she get everything from the house that she wanted, but she got more than she ever dreamed of having: an adventure for the ages, and some heavy-duty bonding with a new girl gang dedicated to solving weighty problems with levity and joy. Are you surprised to learn that that night transformed classmates and acquaintances into deeply connected friends—and a Mistress group that, three years later, has a regularly scheduled call?

她不仅从房子里得到了她想要的一切，而且得到了比她曾经梦想拥有的更多：一个时代的冒险，以及与一个致力于以轻松和快乐解决重大问题的新的女孩帮派的一些重要联系。你惊讶地了解到那个晚上将同学和熟人转变为深度连接的朋友——以及一个三年后定期安排电话的女主人小组（Mistress group）吗？

What had been an incredibly painful prospect, loaded with dread, procrastination, avoidance, guilt, and self-attack, turned into a pirate raid, complete with champagne swigged straight from the bottle—and a celebration of the beginning of a new chapter in Alia's life.

曾经是一个令人难以置信的痛苦前景，充满了恐惧、拖延、回避、内疚和自我攻击，变成了海盗突袭，直接从瓶子里喝香槟——以及庆祝阿莉娅生活中新篇章的开始。

The cost of not asking is much greater than whatever you're not getting by staying silent. The cost is the realization that you're not sitting on the throne of your life, enjoying and being enriched by all the unforgettable experiences, games, and creations that your lust and wild imagination could summon.

不要求的代价远大于你通过保持沉默而得不到的任何东西。代价是意识到你没有坐在你生活的宝座上，享受并被你欲望和狂野想象力所能召唤的所有难忘经历、游戏和创造所丰富。

The kinds of desires you're beginning to excavate will require that you get other people on board: after all, you can't even make an apple pie without inventing the world. So the solution cannot be not to ask, but to get good at it. We will tackle this together, but before we do, it's time for a booster shot.

你开始挖掘的那种欲望将需要你让其他人加入：毕竟，你甚至不能在不发明世界的情况下做一个苹果派。所以解决方案不能是不问，而是要擅长它。我们将一起解决这个问题，但在我们这样做之前，是时候加强注射了。

We need to inoculate you against no.

我们需要给你接种疫苗，让你对"不"免疫。
