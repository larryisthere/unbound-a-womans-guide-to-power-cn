# Chapter 05: YOUR HUNGER KNOWS | 第五章：你的渴望知道

## The Power of Desire | 欲望的力量

What do you really want?

你真正想要什么？

When I ask my students this question, they share their goals and aspirations, personal and career benchmarks they want to achieve. Often, they tell me everything they want to fix and change so that they can move toward a more perfect ideal.

当我问我的学生这个问题时，她们分享她们的目标和抱负，她们想要达到的个人和职业基准。通常，她们告诉我她们想要修复和改变的一切，以便她们能够朝着更完美的理想前进。

But your true desires aren't goals: a cost-of-living raise, an organized garage, shedding those last ten pounds. They're not the cravings you scroll past on Instagram, not your immigrant parents' hard-won dream for you, not everything you think you would want if you were better at being a human.

但你真正的欲望不是目标：生活成本加薪、一个整洁的车库、减掉最后十磅。它们不是你在Instagram上划过的渴望，不是你移民父母为你赢得的梦想，不是如果你更擅长做人时你认为你会想要的一切。

This is not the hunger that knows, the deep subterranean pull that will lead you, full-bodied, toward your destiny. This is not the life force, inciting your animal body to hunt for its greatest pleasure and joy. If anything, these resolutions to fix and improve will only stand in your way.

这不是那个知道的饥饿，那个深深的地下拉力，将引导你，全身心，走向你的命运。这不是生命力，激发你的动物身体去追求它最大的快乐和喜悦。如果有的话，这些修复和改进的决心只会阻碍你。

We're going to dig way deeper than that. The desires I'm talking about in this chapter are the ones that tap into the fire burning deep within you. Because knowing what feeds you, what lights you up, and what you can plug into that will always nourish and inspire you is the power of desire.

我们要挖掘得更深。我在本章中谈论的欲望是那些挖掘你内心深处燃烧的火焰的欲望。因为知道什么滋养你，什么让你发光，以及你可以连接到什么将永远滋养和激励你，这就是欲望的力量。

When we move from fixing ourselves to creating our lives, we shrug off the Good Girl conditioning that tells us we're not enough. When we access the magic of every one of our greedy, lusty desires, we smash the Good Girl taboo of being ashamed for wanting too much. Doing so by plugging into the life force means we won't exhaust ourselves in order to get to some mythical "there" where we'll be replenished; it puts us on a path that will feed us, every step of the way.

当我们从修复自己转向创造我们的生活时，我们摆脱了告诉我们不够好的好女孩条件反射。当我们接触到我们每一个贪婪、充满欲望的欲望的魔力时，我们粉碎了好女孩因想要太多而感到羞耻的禁忌。通过连接到生命力来这样做意味着我们不会为了到达某个神话般的"那里"而耗尽自己，在那里我们会被补充；它把我们放在一条每一步都会滋养我们的道路上。

Knowing what we want is a prerequisite for moving powerfully through the world. Without an intimate, connected relationship to our own desires, all the money and all the resources you're able to secure won't get you anywhere you want to be. This is why so many fantastically rich and "powerful" people are so unhappy, even though they seem to have everything; they have not turned their attention inward to ask themselves what they truly want.

知道我们想要什么是有力地穿越世界的先决条件。没有与我们自己欲望的亲密、连接的关系，你能够获得的所有金钱和所有资源都不会让你到达你想去的任何地方。这就是为什么如此多非常富有和"强大"的人如此不快乐，尽管她们似乎拥有一切；她们没有将注意力向内转来问自己她们真正想要什么。

True desires are a message from you, to you, about what will make you feel truly alive.

真正的欲望是你给你的信息，关于什么会让你感到真正活着。

The task for everyone—whether you have it all, or nothing to speak of—is the same. We start with desire so we know what the power is for.

每个人的任务——无论你拥有一切，还是一无所有——都是相同的。我们从欲望开始，这样我们就知道权力是为了什么。

### Choiceless Choices | 无法选择的选择

True desire is a fully embodied truth, an appetite for what makes you feel truly alive—a lust for the life force. These desires are like the sun: nourishment incarnate, needs so central to your survival that, like a plant, you can't help but turn your face up and grow toward them. Managed skillfully, these kinds of desire are our most potent energy source. They have the power to transform you. Well handled, they take you places you never imagined you'd go.

真正的欲望是一个完全体现的真理，对让你感到真正活着的东西的渴望——对生命力的渴望。这些欲望就像太阳：滋养的化身，对你的生存如此核心的需求，就像植物一样，你忍不住抬起头，向它们生长。巧妙地管理，这些欲望是我们最强大的能量源。它们有力量改变你。处理得当，它们会带你到你从未想象过的地方。

And the very first thing you need to know about those desires? They're nonnegotiable.

关于这些欲望，你需要知道的第一件事是什么？它们是不可谈判的。

By this, I do not mean that you will automatically get what you want. But what you are leaning toward? You don't get to choose.

我这样说，并不是说你自动会得到你想要的。但你倾向于什么？你无法选择。

This goes for turn-ons, deep-seated emotional cravings, ambitions—every category you can name. We tend to talk about these as if we pick them, the way you set a goal or make a New Year's resolution. But nobody says, "I want to want." We don't create desires, and we don't choose them—they arise within us.

这适用于兴奋点、深层次的情感渴望、野心——你能命名的每一个类别。我们倾向于谈论这些，好像我们选择了它们，就像你设定目标或制定新年决心一样。但没有人说："我想想要。"我们不创造欲望，我们也不选择它们——它们在我们内心产生。

We do have a say in whether we discover what our wants are, and in what we do with those desires once we've uncovered them. So there will be a time to choose and declare, and plenty of decisions to be made about how we will bring our creativity to bear on how to proceed.

我们确实在是否发现我们的需求是什么，以及一旦我们发现这些欲望后我们对它们做什么有发言权。所以会有选择和时间来声明，还有很多关于我们将如何运用我们的创造力来处理如何继续的决定。

But the call itself? You don't get to pick that. Nobody does.

但召唤本身呢？你无法选择那个。没有人可以。

Desire is choiceless. You have no say in what you want.

欲望是无法选择的。你对想要什么没有发言权。

This is why desires don't go away when we deny them. A desire that arises and is suppressed, or is poorly identified—one that you don't locate or honor—sticks around. It nags and grouses, whines and lurks, sapping your energy until you acknowledge it.

这就是为什么当我们否认欲望时，它们不会消失。一个出现并被压制的欲望，或者被错误识别的欲望——一个你没有定位或尊重的欲望——会一直存在。它唠叨和抱怨，哀鸣和潜伏，消耗你的能量，直到你承认它。

If you continue to fail to attend to it, you'll find that it causes all kinds of seemingly unrelated mischief. I've seen it a thousand times with students in the late stages of desire suppression: at best, they're collapsed in on themselves; at worst, they find themselves plagued by mysterious illnesses. Desires will not be ignored.

如果你继续忽视它，你会发现它会引起各种看似无关的恶作剧。我在处于欲望压制后期的学生身上看到过一千次：最好的情况下，她们崩溃在自己身上；最坏的情况下，她们发现自己被神秘的疾病困扰。欲望不会被忽视。

I'll say it again: You are responsible not for the existence of a desire, only for how you choose to play or engage with it. So you don't necessarily have to give in to it, but you do have to see it. The game begins once you acknowledge what you want.

我再说一遍：你不为欲望的存在负责，只为你如何选择与它游戏或互动负责。所以你不一定必须屈服于它，但你确实必须看到它。一旦你承认你想要什么，游戏就开始了。

It's true: desire can be a monster. She scoffs at good choices and sound judgment. She doesn't care if you're happily married while she's leading you into the arms of another. She doesn't care that you need to pay your bills when she's convincing you that it's a good idea to quit your corporate job so you can do experimental performance art, full-time. She can take down friendships, companies, governments.

确实如此：欲望可能是一个怪物。她嘲笑好的选择和合理的判断。她不在乎你是否幸福地结婚，而她却把你引向另一个人的怀抱。她不在乎你需要付账单，当她说服你辞去公司工作，这样你就可以全职做实验性表演艺术是个好主意时。她可以摧毁友谊、公司、政府。

And yet, all change begins with her. This is why a big part of my role in teaching women how to get what they want is training them to be creative about this usually inconvenient and sometimes downright destructive force. Because when a woman knows what she likes, what would fulfill her, what would make her happy—which direction she wishes to grow in next—she is mapping her destiny.

然而，所有的改变都始于她。这就是为什么我在教女性如何得到她们想要的东西时，我的很大一部分角色是训练她们对这个通常不方便有时完全是破坏性的力量变得有创意。因为当女人知道她喜欢什么，什么会满足她，什么会让她快乐——她希望接下来朝哪个方向成长——她就在绘制她的命运。

So let's play. Let's liberate our imaginations, unleash our inner Pippi Longstocking, the giddy, cartwheeling rebel inside all of us.

所以让我们玩吧。让我们解放我们的想象力，释放我们内心的长袜子皮皮，我们所有人内心那个眩晕、翻筋斗的反叛者。

When you get a glimpse of that adventure and magic, when you start to feel the glimmer of that excitement in your body, heart, and mind, you will find a whole new set of uses for the power practices you are about to learn. They will help you not only to solve the very serious problems in our world, but to ensure that you have a damn good time creating the kind of life that makes you wake up wanting to dance.

当你瞥见那个冒险和魔法时，当你开始在身体、心灵和思想中感受到那种兴奋的光芒时，你会发现你即将学习的权力实践的全新用途。它们不仅会帮助你解决我们世界中非常严重的问题，而且会确保你在创造那种让你醒来想要跳舞的生活时度过一段美好的时光。

#### EXERCISE | 练习

##### The Bad Girl Protocol | 坏女孩准则

This exercise is a playground where you get to do whatever the fuck you want to do.

这个练习是一个游乐场，在那里你可以做任何你想做的事。

Meet your inner Bad Girl.

认识你内心的坏女孩。

On a sheet of paper, copy the following prompt:

在一张纸上，复制以下提示：

IF I WERE A BAD GIRL, I WOULD ___________.

如果我是一个坏女孩，我会___________。

What would you do if you allowed yourself to break all your rules? What kind of trouble would you try to get into, if there were no consequences—for anything?

如果你允许自己打破所有规则，你会做什么？如果没有后果——对任何事情都没有——你会尝试陷入什么样的麻烦？

Be as playful, as greedy, as selfish, as frivolous, as lawless, as vain, as neglectful and useless and lazy, as hypersexual, and as straight-up evil as you want to be.

尽可能顽皮、贪婪、自私、轻浮、无法无天、虚荣、疏忽、无用和懒惰、过度性化，以及你想成为的完全邪恶。

Think about the sex you want, the justice you want, money you want to spend, the laws you want to change or break. Conjure the people you most want to humiliate, or spread your legs for.

想想你想要性，你想要的正义，你想花的钱，你想改变或打破的法律。想象你最想羞辱的人，或者为他们张开双腿的人。

Let yourself be a slut, a tyrant, a seductress, a spoiled princess, a con artist, and a pampered, delicate little flower who can't do a thing for herself.

让自己成为一个荡妇、暴君、诱惑者、被宠坏的公主、骗子，以及一个被宠坏的、娇嫩的小花，她无法为自己做任何事。

Maybe what you're envisioning is wild, generative, and hilarious; maybe it would blow up your life. Both are great. Don't judge your Bad Girl Protocol; this is a free-for-all. Invite all the sides of you to come out to play, especially the ones you don't ordinarily invite to the party. Let the lustiest, greediest, most shameless version of yourself free.

也许你设想的是狂野的、生成的、可笑的；也许它会炸毁你的生活。两者都很棒。不要评判你的坏女孩准则；这是一个自由竞争。邀请你的所有面向出来玩，特别是那些你通常不邀请参加聚会的面向。让你最色情、最贪婪、最无耻的版本自由。

Some examples from my students, to get you going:

我学生的一些例子，让你开始：

"I'd hold an American Idol–style televised audition for sperm donors. They'd have to wear swimsuits, sing, and do a striptease to prove their DNA is the best. America decides."

"我会举办一场《美国偶像》风格的电视精子捐献者试镜。他们必须穿泳装、唱歌，并做脱衣舞来证明他们的DNA是最好的。美国决定。"

"I'd keep a harem in my basement, make them scour my house while I'm at work—and then take turns giving me oral sex for hours on the clean sheets. In this Bad Girl's house, sexual gratification goes only one way."

"我会在地下室养一个后宫，让我在工作时打扫房子——然后在干净的床单上轮流给我口交几个小时。在这个坏女孩的房子里，性满足只朝一个方向。"

"I'd steal a giant pile of diamonds and crash celebrity parties under the name of a countess of a country that doesn't exist."

"我会偷一堆巨大的钻石，以不存在的国家的伯爵夫人的名义闯入名人聚会。"

"I'd get my ex to leave coffee and the newspaper and a toasted, well-buttered corn muffin from the best bakery in the city on my doorstep every single morning—without me ever having to lay eyes on him."

"我会让我的前男友每天早上在我家门口留下咖啡和报纸，以及城市最好面包店的一个烤得好的、黄油充分的玉米松饼——而不必看到他一眼。"

"I'd start a girl gang to roam around torturing men for various offenses, including catcalling and manspreading."

"我会组建一个女孩帮派，到处游荡，折磨男人，因为他们犯下的各种罪行，包括街头骚扰和男人伸展。"

Use these as inspiration to think of no one but yourself. Keep going until you run out of steam.

用这些作为灵感，只想你自己。继续下去，直到你精疲力竭。

### The Good Girl Jailbreak | 好女孩越狱

Why does doing the Bad Girl Protocol feel so good?

为什么做坏女孩准则感觉这么好？

The answer lies in its name—which, by the way, is deliberate, even though I hear the occasional complaint from new students about the word "girl." A little kid doesn't care how many grams of sugar are in a chocolate bar or how much something costs. She doesn't concern herself with the logistical difficulties involved in keeping a pony on the tenth floor of a New York apartment building. She just wants what she wants—until it gets trained out of her.

答案在于它的名字——顺便说一句，这是故意的，尽管我听到新学生偶尔抱怨"女孩"这个词。小孩子不在乎巧克力棒里有多少克糖或某物的价格。她不关心在纽约公寓楼的十楼养小马所涉及的物流困难。她只是想要她想要的——直到它被训练出她。

When I first started teaching, I spent a lot of time wondering why so many women default to complaining instead of simply asking for what they want. I can't think of a single complaint that couldn't be stated as a desire, and with a far better result. So why is it so much easier to say, "You never buy me flowers," than it is to ask for a bouquet?

当我刚开始教学时，我花了很多时间想知道为什么这么多女性默认抱怨而不是简单地要求她们想要的。我想不出一个不能表达为欲望的抱怨，而且结果要好得多。那么为什么说"你从来不给我买花"比要求一束花要容易得多呢？

The answer has to do with a culture-wide prohibition against female appetite. Good Girls aren't supposed to want anything; we're supposed to be wanted. It's not "attractive" to admit that you're hungry, or that you want sex. Wanting success makes us seem unfeminine; a desire for love makes us seem weak.

答案与文化范围内对女性欲望的禁止有关。好女孩不应该想要任何东西；我们应该被想要。承认你饿了，或者你想要性，并不"有吸引力"。想要成功让我们显得不够女性化；对爱的渴望让我们显得软弱。

Too much, too little: it's the Smush all over again.

太多，太少：又是挤压。

This is what makes a complaint so much easier for most women to access than a request. It's also why connecting to our desire—and then going out into the world and enlisting others to help make those desires come true—is so effective at breaking this compression.

这就是为什么对大多数女性来说，抱怨比请求更容易获得。这也是为什么连接到我们的欲望——然后走出去，招募其他人帮助实现这些欲望——在打破这种压迫方面如此有效。

The most radical thing a woman can do is want.

一个女人能做的最激进的事就是想要。

Knowing that every complaint hides a desire is a useful insight, though, especially because it's helpful at peeling back Good Girl conditioning to get at some of our deep-seated desires.

然而，知道每个抱怨都隐藏着一个欲望是一个有用的洞察，特别是因为它有助于剥离好女孩条件反射，找到我们一些深层次的欲望。

If you make a list of everything you complain about, from the way your tech-bro boss fist-bumps everyone in the office, to the run you found in your stocking this morning, you will find that some of the desires masquerading as complaints can be easily dispatched: if you bought ten pairs of better-quality stockings, then getting dressed in the morning would be much less of a pain.

如果你列出你抱怨的所有事情，从你的科技兄弟老板在办公室里和每个人击掌的方式，到今天早上你在袜子上发现的抽丝，你会发现一些伪装成抱怨的欲望可以很容易地被解决：如果你买了十双质量更好的袜子，那么早上穿衣服就不会那么痛苦了。

But others will still nag, an indication that the desire hiding behind the complaint is bigger than you initially suspected. Is your desire for a bouquet of flowers a simple one—you love freesias, and would like to have some? Or does "You never buy me flowers" hide the desire for an entirely new, rejuvenated romantic landscape—for your partner of a decade to become your seducer again, with two-hour-long body worship sessions and rose petals and love letters left on your pillow?

但其他的仍会唠叨，这表明隐藏在抱怨背后的欲望比你最初怀疑的更大。你对一束花的渴望是简单的——你爱小苍兰，想要一些？还是"你从来不给我买花"隐藏了对一个全新的、重获新生的浪漫风景的渴望——让你十年的伴侣再次成为你的诱惑者，有两个小时的身体崇拜会议，玫瑰花瓣和情书留在你的枕头上？

One of my students listed her workspace as a complaint when we did this exercise in class. "I know it seems petty, but I can't stand my desk at work, and I can't get it changed. It's ugly, the drawers stick, it's enormous, and I hate sitting behind it. It's so trivial! But it's driving me nuts."

我的一个学生在我们做这个练习时把她的工作空间列为抱怨。"我知道这看起来很小气，但我受不了我工作的桌子，我无法更换它。它很丑，抽屉卡住了，它很大，我讨厌坐在它后面。这太琐碎了！但它让我发疯。"

After a few passes, my student began to realize that her complaint was really with the Kafkaesque hoops she'd have to jump through in order to get her desk changed. The frustration she was feeling about her desk was directly related to the frustration she felt trying to get anything done or changed in her workplace, a government office badly overburdened by bureaucracy.

经过几次尝试后，我的学生开始意识到她的抱怨实际上是为了更换桌子而必须跳过的卡夫卡式的圈套。她对桌子的挫败感与她试图在工作场所完成或改变任何事情时感到的挫败感直接相关，这是一个被官僚主义严重过度负担的政府办公室。

The exciting realization was that within her complaint, there was an opening for her to make authentic change. Because the true, hidden desire behind her complaint wasn't another desk with drawers, but an influential conversation with her boss where she shared her ideas about how to make the office more efficient, more productive, and inspiring for everyone who worked there.

令人兴奋的发现是，在她的抱怨中，有一个让她做出真实改变的机会。因为隐藏在她抱怨背后的真正的、隐藏的欲望不是另一个带抽屉的桌子，而是与老板进行一次有影响力的对话，她分享了她关于如何让办公室更高效、更有生产力、并激励在那里工作的每个人的想法。

Before the class was over, she'd asked her boss for a meeting.

在课程结束之前，她向老板要求了一次会议。

"How much do you care about that desk now?" I asked her.

"你现在对那张桌子有多关心？"我问她。

"If he gives me that meeting and takes my ideas seriously, I'll work from the floor."

"如果他给我那次会议并认真对待我的想法，我会在地板上工作。"

### Panning for Gold: The Power of Specificity | 淘金：具体化的力量

Desires often appear first to us in the form of vague impulses, a loosely sketched fantasy, a nagging sensation that you'd like to try something different. This imprecision is a completely normal and necessary part of the process.

欲望通常首先以模糊的冲动形式出现在我们面前，一个粗略勾勒的幻想，一种你想尝试不同事物的唠叨感。这种不精确是完全正常和必要的过程的一部分。

Beginning to feel these desires is an essential first step. But power is inviting others to participate in the creation of your envisioned reality. Before we can go after these desires and invite others to participate in collaborating with us to make them come true, we have to refine them, separating them from the fears and expectations that often accompany them. Think of an archaeologist delicately brushing debris from a find in order to reveal the treasure beneath.

开始感受这些欲望是必要的第一步。但权力是邀请他人参与创造你设想的现实。在我们能够追求这些欲望并邀请他人参与与我们合作使它们成为现实之前，我们必须精炼它们，将它们与经常伴随它们的恐惧和期望分开。想想一个考古学家轻轻地从发现物上刷去碎片，以揭示下面的宝藏。

Getting specific makes a desire tactile, so that you can feel it in your body. Consider the difference between "I want romance" and "I want to be held tightly for at least ten minutes, in an all-encompassing, never-let-me-go kind of hug."

变得具体使欲望变得触觉化，这样你就能在身体中感受到它。考虑"我想要浪漫"和"我想要被紧紧拥抱至少十分钟，在一个包罗万象、永不让我走的拥抱中"之间的区别。

What happens when you formulate your desire that way? The first thing is that you know—right away—whether it's right or not. You think about getting that hug, and either your body relaxes—"Yes! That's totally what I want!"—or you start feeling a little uncomfortable, a little claustrophobic, indicating that the Ask you came up with to satisfy the desire wasn't exactly the right one. That's fine: it simply means you have to get connected again to what you want, then come up with another Ask.

当你这样表达你的欲望时会发生什么？首先，你知道——立即——它是否正确。你想到得到那个拥抱，要么你的身体放松——"是的！这正是我想要的！"——要么你开始感到有点不舒服，有点幽闭恐惧症，表明你想出的满足欲望的要求并不完全正确。那没关系：这只是意味着你必须重新连接到你想要的东西，然后想出另一个要求。

And if it is what you want, then everything you're feeling will be present in the signal you send to the other person when you do ask, including a detailed energetic map of what you want. Any time you ask for something, the other person's animal body is hearing a lot more than you think. When you're connected to a deeply detailed vision of your desire, you will transmit the subtle contours of that map. If you're unconsciously bringing all the times they've let you down to your Ask, or asking with the belief that they'll never get it right, you're instructing their animal body in hopelessness—"You'll never get this right."

如果这就是你想要的，那么你感受到的一切都会在你提出要求时发送给另一个人的信号中出现，包括你想要的东西的详细能量图。每当你要求某物时，另一个人的动物身体听到的比你想象的要多得多。当你连接到你的欲望的深度详细愿景时，你将传递那个地图的微妙轮廓。如果你无意识地将他们让你失望的所有时间带到你的要求中，或者带着他们永远不会做对的信念来要求，你就是在用绝望指导他们的动物身体——"你永远不会做对。"

Whether you're asking for the kind of sex you want, a raise, a small favor, or conveying your vision for the country during a presidential debate, the conversation under the conversation begins with you.

无论你是在要求你想要的性，加薪，一个小恩惠，还是在总统辩论中传达你对国家的愿景，对话下的对话都从你开始。

### The Book of Desires | 欲望之书

The Bad Girl Protocol is fantastic at getting us out of a rut—at breaking the compression of the Smush by giving us permission to see and want whatever it is that we want. The reckless freedom it imparts burns off Good Girl conditioning, as well as all the rage and vitriol and pain that come along with that conditioning.

坏女孩准则在让我们摆脱困境方面非常出色——通过允许我们看到和想要我们想要的东西来打破挤压的压迫。它赋予的鲁莽自由烧掉了好女孩条件反射，以及所有随之而来的愤怒、尖刻和痛苦。

It prepares us for our desires.

它为我们准备好我们的欲望。

The next exercise, the Book of Desires, is for everything you unearth in the process. If your Bad Girl Protocol had an entry about storming into your boss's office, climbing up onto his desk, and peeing on it, as one of my students' did (Hi, Daiyu!), then what goes into your Book of Desires is what remains: in this case, the specific acknowledgments that would make my student feel appreciated in her workplace.

下一个练习，欲望之书，是为了你在过程中发现的一切。如果你的坏女孩准则有一个关于冲进你老板办公室，爬上他的桌子，并在上面小便的条目，就像我的一个学生做的那样（你好，黛玉！），那么进入你的欲望之书的是剩下的东西：在这种情况下，会让我的学生在工作场所感到被欣赏的具体认可。

Both are necessary, especially because many of us would never arrive at that second desire without getting wicked first.

两者都是必要的，特别是因为我们中的许多人如果不先变得邪恶，就永远不会到达第二个欲望。

#### EXERCISE | 练习

##### Book of Desires | 欲望之书

As we start delving into power dynamics and all the ways that you can create new roles for the people in your life by asking, you will need to know what the deepest parts of you need and want. This is where your Book of Desires comes in. It is a protected space where you safeguard important messages from you to you, about what makes you feel alive.

当我们开始深入研究权力动态以及你可以通过要求为你生活中的人创造新角色的所有方式时，你需要知道你最深层部分需要和想要什么。这就是你的欲望之书发挥作用的地方。它是一个受保护的空间，你可以在那里保护从你到你的重要信息，关于什么让你感到活着。

You may choose to carry around a little notebook or to create a special folder in the Notes app on your phone. As you move through your day, log anything and everything that you would like to have. Write down as much as you can, as often as you can.

你可以选择随身携带一个小笔记本，或者在手机上的Notes应用程序中创建一个特殊文件夹。当你度过一天时，记录你想要拥有的任何东西和一切。尽可能多地写下，尽可能经常地写下。

Over time, your desires will become refined; for now, document them with a sense of freedom.

随着时间的推移，你的欲望会变得精炼；现在，以自由感记录它们。

Your entries may be huge: a phenomenal life purpose, fame and celebrity, enormous wealth, leisure time, a baby, a cloistered artistic life, sainthood—or a pair of kitten-heeled pink fuzzy slippers, a shiny new hardcover book, or black coconut ice cream. They can be venal, or epic acts of humanitarianism; they can be snacks. Be indiscriminate: "I want a city of tree houses, connected by rope bridges and zip lines."

你的条目可能很大：一个非凡的人生目标、名望和名人、巨大的财富、休闲时间、一个婴儿、一个隐居的艺术生活、圣徒身份——或者一双小猫跟粉色毛茸茸拖鞋、一本闪亮的新精装书，或黑色椰子冰淇淋。它们可能是卑鄙的，或者史诗般的人道主义行为；它们可能是零食。不加区别："我想要一个树屋城市，用绳桥和滑索连接。"

The only criterion: that your body feels a sense of expansion and elation when you think about having what you have written. Follow your feeling sense. Make sure every entry lights you up and excites you, sending a lightning bolt right down to your pussy. The body knows. Which desires make you feel most alive?

唯一的标准：当你想到拥有你写的东西时，你的身体会感到扩展和兴奋。跟随你的感觉。确保每个条目都让你发光和兴奋，将一道闪电直接发送到你的阴道。身体知道。哪些欲望让你感觉最活着？

Self-attack will only slow down the process, so in these early stages, go gently. Mark it, sketch it, get it wrong, knowing that even the slightest move in the direction of what you truly want is of real value.

自我攻击只会减慢过程，所以在这些早期阶段，要温和地进行。标记它，勾画它，出错，知道即使朝着你真正想要的方向的最轻微移动也是有真正价值的。

One caution: Your Book of Desires should not read like a to-do list. Don't let reality pollute your log! If it starts to go that way, imagine that you're commanding a fictional support staff with infinite energy and resources. Whatever you want, they will make it happen.

一个警告：你的欲望之书不应该读起来像待办事项清单。不要让现实污染你的日志！如果它开始朝那个方向发展，想象你正在指挥一个拥有无限能量和资源的虚构支持团队。无论你想要什么，他们都会让它发生。

As long as you're bound to figuring out how you can make something happen, you're bound to the ground, and to the reality of today. This will prevent you from clearly seeing this desire, much less the one that lies underneath it, or the one underneath that. Be impractical, unreasonable; we will eventually return to earth, but for now, we need to take flight. And let go of the concept of "deserving." As we've said, you have no say in what you want.

只要你被束缚在弄清楚如何让某事发生，你就会被束缚在地面上，被束缚在今天现实中。这将阻止你清楚地看到这个欲望，更不用说下面的那个，或者下面的那个。要不切实际，不合理；我们最终会回到地球，但现在，我们需要起飞。放下"值得"的概念。正如我们所说，你对想要什么没有发言权。

Don't wait until you've bought a special notebook, or until you feel ready, or have thought of a "good one." Put this book down right now and write something—anything, or a lot of things—in your Book of Desires.

不要等到你买了一本特殊的笔记本，或者直到你感觉准备好了，或者想出了一个"好的"。现在就放下这本书，在你的欲望之书中写一些东西——任何东西，或者很多东西。

### Your Desire Is Your Destiny | 你的欲望就是你的命运

In the pages that follow, you will allow some of these desires to blossom into articulated requests. You will feed and test what you want with different kinds of Asks, and various invitations to collaborate.

在接下来的页面中，你将允许这些欲望中的一些发展成明确的要求。你将用不同类型的要求和各种合作邀请来滋养和测试你想要的东西。

The important thing to know is that this process—moving from desire to Ask, and then another, and then another—doesn't end. It's a way to live.

重要的是要知道，这个过程——从欲望到要求，然后另一个，然后另一个——不会结束。这是一种生活方式。

Sometimes my students ask for things, get them, and discover what they asked for is not what they wanted. This happens all the time: you believe that a particular job, or a particular lover, or a particular piece of cake will make you happy. Sometimes it's perfect! Sometimes it's close, but not quite right. Other times, the reality—for a million different reasons—fails to live up to the dream.

有时我的学生要求一些东西，得到它们，然后发现她们要求的不是她们想要的。这种情况经常发生：你相信某个特定的工作，或某个特定的情人，或某个特定的蛋糕会让你快乐。有时它是完美的！有时它很接近，但不太对。其他时候，现实——由于一百万个不同的原因——没有达到梦想。

Often, this used to shame and silence us: "You said if you got X, you'd be happy, and now you have it and you're not happy and this is clear evidence that you're a terrible person who doesn't know what she wants and doesn't deserve happiness."

通常，这过去常常让我们感到羞耻和沉默："你说如果你得到X，你会快乐，现在你有了它，你不快乐，这清楚地证明你是一个不知道她想要什么、不值得幸福的可怕的人。"

But there's absolutely no reason that asking for the wrong thing should be where the asking ends. That's just information: you use what you've learned about yourself and the shape of your desire to make another Ask.

但绝对没有理由要求错误的东西应该是要求的结束。这只是信息：你使用你学到的关于你自己和你的欲望形状的知识来提出另一个要求。

And while it's common to talk about the satisfaction of a desire as a bad thing—once you've gotten what you want, you don't want it anymore, and you move on to wanting something else—I always wonder: Why is this a bad thing? A desire satisfied is a step completed. Why would you want the most recent step you took to be your last? What a static way of looking at human identity, and at our life experience!

虽然通常把满足欲望说成是坏事——一旦你得到了你想要的，你就不再想要它了，你继续想要别的东西——我总是想知道：为什么这是坏事？满足的欲望是完成的一步。为什么你会希望你最近走的一步是你最后的一步？这是一种多么静态的看待人类身份和我们生活经历的方式！

Of course, what you want will change over time. Who you think you are will change, too. Being able to periodically ask yourself these questions—What makes me feel alive today? What do I desire at this moment?—is the only way to stay updated with yourself as a being who evolves. Each new desire represents the next step on your unique path.

当然，你想要的东西会随着时间的推移而改变。你认为你是谁也会改变。能够定期问自己这些问题——今天什么让我感到活着？这一刻我想要什么？——是与你作为一个进化的存在保持更新的唯一方式。每一个新的欲望都代表着你独特道路上的下一步。

Live in accordance with your desires, and you will make a life that is absolutely, uniquely your own.

按照你的欲望生活，你将创造一个绝对独特的、属于你自己的生活。

When you are able to read your deepest inner signal, and understand that you have no say in what you truly want, you are using your life force as a compass, and it's the only one you need. When you find creative ways to honor those internal signals, you are guaranteed to find your unique destiny.

当你能够阅读你最深层的内在信号，并理解你对真正想要什么没有发言权时，你正在使用你的生命力作为指南针，这是你唯一需要的。当你找到创造性的方式来尊重这些内在信号时，你一定会找到你独特的命运。

It is the most satisfying way I know to live.

这是我所知道的最令人满意的生活方式。
